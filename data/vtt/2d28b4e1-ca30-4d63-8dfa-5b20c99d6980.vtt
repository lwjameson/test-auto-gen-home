00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Bradley King: Hi everyone! 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Welcome to this event! Can everyone hear me I assume you can? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Speaker without photo: Yes hi!! BK: Hi thank you! (laughter from unknown speaker)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: There are still many people showing up and I'm going to let them in as a welcome you. Thank you for coming. Thank you for donating. Thank you for your patience.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: There will be connections tonight. There will be connection disruptions. There will be connection euphoria. So try to bear with us as we try to make this work gracefully.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: I want to begin by thanking Sarah la Puerta who organized this whole event. This is her vision and we owe her our gratitude for this night. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: And we owe her our gratitude for this night. Thank you also to Kyle Schlesinger and Cuneiform Press 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Unknown speaker: Yay!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: And thanks for you for saying yay and donating, and coming, and thanks most of all to Bernadette Mayer for writing poetry and for creating these vitalizing energy vessels for us all to enjoy 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Well more than enjoy, to draw upon as we try to live. Um, if you want to donate tonight here's how you do it. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Many of you have already donated but if you want to donate again or...if you have not donated yet and would like to

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Will someone confirm that they can? Audience: YES! BK: Ok 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: And the first announcement I will make is that if you purchase anything from Cuneiform Press tonight. The money that you pay for your books will go directly to the Bernadette mayer fund. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: So if you have been thinking about any Cuneiform Press releases, which, he has many this summer, Kyle has been hard at work this summer. I have the website listed there. Search around if you buy books the money will go to our cause this evening. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: I also wanna say. Um, I think I'm recording this. I have this meeting set up to where it's supposed to automatically record, but if you would like to record I believe I also have it set up to where you can just press record and you should be able to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: And if anyone has, if anyone is trying to record and is struggling to record well let me know send me a message and I'll see what I can do. (Bradley changes his Zoom background to The Northern Lights) yeah, that seems more right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Um, if you want to learn about Bernadette Mayer and her life in poetry and the great work she has done for all of us 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: then there are lots of places you can read about that and so tonight instead of telling you about her in an introduction I am just going to ask Bernadettte a couple questions

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Um, Bernadette are you ready? Bernadette Mayer: Yes, dear.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Uh, well, the first thing I wanna ask you is did you see anyting terrific or fascinating in your yard today? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: Hmmm, An orange tree. BK: An orange tree? Oh hm, well did the tree have oranges on it? Or..?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: It is a tree that turns orange. (Laughter)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Well, I'm glad you said that because I also wanted to ask you about color, I've heard that you have some ideas or you like to talk about the color of letters of the alphabet. And I was just going to ask you to say a bit about the color letters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: Oh, uh, ok, well A is red. B is pink. C is ochre. D is black.  

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
 BM: What comes after D? E, green. F who's that? Voice off screen: It's Neely. BM: Oh it's Neely! F is blue gray. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: G is brown. H blue gray. I gray, J, brown, K black, L gray, O a beautiful white! 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: M brown, N, should I go on? BK: Yeah, please! BM: N, O white, P, blue, dark blue, uhhh, Q is golden

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: R is burnt orange, S yellow, T dark blue gray, U gray, V blue, What comes after V? W, brown, X golden, Y, yellow, Z, brown. BK: Brown? What comes after brown? BM laughs loudly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: Well nothing really. Every synesthete has a different color for every letter so somebody's else's letters would would be a different color. BK: I see. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Do you have these memorized or? Do they come to you differently each time. BM: I can't hear. BK: I say do they come to you differently or are they always the same each time? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: No they're always the same. They've been the same since I was a child. Just a letter is a certain color and it just stays that way forever

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Even if you know like Nabokov (changing to Russian pronunciation) NabOkov said there playing with blocks when he was a kid, they're all the wrong colors  and his mother said yes I know. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Did the colors of the letters ever seem like the wrong colors to you? BM: Yeah they do. But I always enjoyed the fact that E was green. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Because it mean as I said very often to my grand daughter it means free money is green. BM laughs. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: I'm gonna keep my eyes open for the letter E now. BM: What? Philip Good: Keep your eyes open for the letter E. BK: Can I ask you one more question?   

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: MMmhmmM. BK: I wanted to ask you what you favorite thought that you've had today was. BM: Yeah, um, gee. PG: The maple tree. The tree. in the creek. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: The um, OH! Well, I dont know if it's my favorite thought but we were walking by the Kinderhook creek and we could see the trees above and I pointed to this really orange tree. And I asked Phil who was with me. Is this our tree? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: Now this is not a favorite thought. It is just an odd thought to think that a tree belongs to you. Sound of someone watching TV (maybe Narcos?) very loudly. back to BK in speaker: now you found yourself with this odd thought.  

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BM: Who's that? PG: I don't know. BK: Who's got their TV on?!  

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: My god I don't know what to do with this. Someone is not muted. MUTE MUTE MUTE. OK. Well before we get to the readings, thank you Bernadette for talking with me, before we get to the readings I wanna do, I'm your telethon fool this evening. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: I'm gonna be making announcements about how to donate money to our cause. So there's one way that you can do that. I'm gonna share my screen and I think I have a beautiful image to share with you. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Can you all confirm that you see this? That everybody can see what we're looking.  A number of voices: Yes! 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Sound of appreciative ooos and ahhs. BK: These are Bernadette Mayer sonnets. In case you don't know, Bernadette Mayer is an innovator of many, many literary genres, including Utopia Visions and Journals and Sonnets and um, Sharon Ruse who is a master calligrapher from Austin, Texas 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Has written out some of her favorite of Bernadette's sonnets and these are kind of the grand prize for donations. But if you feel moved to donate 500 dollars to our honarium for Bernadette Mayer and Philip's cause to buy a generator tonight these are available. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: Phenomenon of Chaos has already been claimed but this sonnet here (BK scrolls through quickly to Sonnet with the first line, "Other than what's gone on and stupid art") and this sonnet here, C'mere Tell me the rest of it, these are still available.The artwork around the edges was done by another friend of Cuneiform Press Philip Trussel who is a poet. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK:painter and hermetic scholar who also lives in Austin. So I'm gonna stop that screenshare. If anyone has any questions about how to donate just contact me of Kyle Schlesinger or Sarah La Puerta in the chat. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: And well I'll be telling you more about this as the evening goes on. Now we're gonna do a series of short readings. Oh more people to admit to the meeting! Here they come. There will be a handful of poets and we're gonna do a set of readings in honor of Bernadette and I'm going to begin. We'll go in a sorta circle if that's what you wanna call it. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
BK: And um, then we'll take the evening from there. Some I'm gonna read two poems, from a long poem or I guess two stanzas if you wanna call them from a long poem that I recently wrote and the name of the poem is Hey Craig. And this is stanza number 20.  

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
ZD: Against the paperlike wind she clutched the train as she lowered herself out of an exit and braced for impact. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
ZD: Thank you, um, Kevin is next. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
