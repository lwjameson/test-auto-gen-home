Music

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A wonderful good morning on day four of the 34th Chaos Communication Congress.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm glad that so many of you are already here and we'll start right away so we don't get lost again.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Leander Seige is with me on stage and he'll tell you something about the International Image Interoperability Framework.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Cultural institutions create interoperable interfaces for digitalized cultural goods.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Please give a big round of applause for Leander.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Thank you very much. I wish you a wonderful morning.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm very happy that even though today is the fourth conference day, you have already appeared here for the first talk.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Thank you very much. I'm glad that I have the opportunity to present my current favorite technology,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the International Image Interoperability Framework,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which allows interoperable interfaces for digitalized cultural goods to be realized.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I have very few words for myself. I work at the Leipzig University Library.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm responsible for the field of digital services and I have a lot to do with these things.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But I'm also personally enthusiastic about it and that leads to the fact that I'm doing some small,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
self-motivated private projects in this field. I'll show you a small example later.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I think it's well known and many would agree that digitalized images are nowadays a fundamental information carrier,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
cultural heritage, manuscripts, prints, drawings and paintings and many other things are much better accessible in this way.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In the past, access was only possible exclusively for researchers. Today it is possible for everyone.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The original experience is therefore much more secure.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Digitalization is nothing new, but until now digitalization was often associated with the fact that the data,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the metadata and the digitalized images themselves were presented in silo-like systems,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000
which were hardly compatible with other data, were therefore difficult to provide images internally,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and were always individually linked to the realization of the respective portal.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I have taken an example from our own library here, an old Bible manuscript,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which I will introduce later, where this was the case. When this portal was built, it was a very modern and progressive portal.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But nowadays it cannot meet these demands, which are being applied today.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And yes, I'll get to that in a moment.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So here again a sense of what the situation is often like, how digitalized presentations are often realized on the network.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The systems are isolated, carry their institutional character to the outside and are access to the repositories,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
which is nice, but they are not interoperable with each other.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And this point is addressed by the International Image Interoperability Framework,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
which was specifically designed for this purpose, namely a standard AP layer between the actual repositories,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000
i.e. the storage systems for digitized images and the metadata.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And to connect these APIs with the presentations, so that the data from different repositories

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:50.000
can be put together in different, not necessarily institutional, i.e. private work surfaces, virtually, by the user himself.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The community around this framework has grown quite a bit.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.000
It was formed from a community of Stanford University Libraries, the British Library and the libraries in Oxford.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
In the meantime, the community has grown very strongly.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
In Germany, it is mainly the Bavarian State Library, which is very committed to this.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
The University Library Leipzig does the same, the French National Library and many others.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
In the community, many international, important libraries, universities, national libraries,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and even the Vatican Library are now providing their digitalization in this interoperable format.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
There are currently four APIs that are specified under the CCBI license.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Two of these APIs are actually required to start a presentation.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This is the Image API, which actually delivers the pixels.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And there is the Presentation API, which is there to define the structure and metadata of these pixels

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and make them interoperable.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Other APIs then deal with the topic of search and authentication,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but I'm not going into that here because that would blow up the framework.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The particularly nice thing about this standard is that it relies on linked data.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The data is typically stored in JSON-LD.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The identifiers for the various things in this data are usually HTTP URIs, which are therefore solvable.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And also the reference of metadata from different sources to each other

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
makes it possible to save completely independently of your own data.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:07.000
A few words about the Presentation API, which models the hierarchy in which the metadata is stored.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
First there are the collections, which therefore summarize several works into a meaningful unit.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Such collections can also be created by yourself.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Researchers can put together their own research collections,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
which consist of manifest files that then define sequences of images.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
A manifest file describes a work that consists of image sequences.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
These image sequences are canvas objects, i.e. pure page objects,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
which are then annotated by content, by images, but that can also be texts.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I'll go back to the slide.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:01.000
You can see very nicely on this slide how this abstract canvas object is finally annotated with the actual image content,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
which enables this canvas object to be described through several different image files

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and texts, text descriptions, transcriptions and perhaps even translations.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
The manifest files are built like this.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I have here a schematic overview.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:34.000
You don't have to look at it exactly, it should only describe how the internal structure is built in a linked data manner.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And according to the same mode, the annotations are structured in these systems, which the users can also apply themselves,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
so that it is possible to have your own annotations in your own storage system

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.000
related to objects that don't even have to be in my own storage system.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
This functionality is displayed on this slide.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:16.000
It is therefore possible to use IIIF presentation systems to summarize the images from different repositories

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000
into a virtual research environment, to use this term,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and then to store the scientific notes in different annotations.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
For the APIs of IIIF there are now numerous software applications.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I'm always using only one example here, which I will also show live.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
For the presentation API there are some viewers who can represent the digitization.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I would like to mention the Mirador Viewer, which is multi-documentable,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
so it can collect different digitizations from different sources

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and also has extensive functions of image manipulation and annotation.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The image API that actually delivers the images is very dynamically structured,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
that means you can actually tell the image server that this API corresponds

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000
which section of an image is scaled or not scaled, etc.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So you can also ask for image manipulation directly from the server,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
which then prepares the digitization accordingly, and so it is possible to take over

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000
the digitization that is provided by institutions dynamically in its own applications.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
As with the presentation API, there is a whole range of software products

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that realize the image server on this technology. For example, I call this the IP Image Server.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000
This is a fast CGI module for Apache that is provided under the GPLv3.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And this server is able to implement this presentation API,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and it does so on the basis of preprocessed image files.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
For this you apply image files that contain several solutions of the digitization

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and ideally are already understaffed in tiles that are then dynamically delivered by the image server.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Unfortunately, there is only a small selection of software with which such files can be created at the moment.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
TIFF files can be produced quite well with ImageMagic, but for JPEG 2000 it is already more difficult.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Unfortunately, there is only the commercial solution Kakadu,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and the OpenJPEG implementation is being improved in this context to be able to be used.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Example number 1, the Papyrus Ebers, I would like to present briefly.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Now it will be a bit practical, I will show a few demos.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
The Papyrus Ebers is a scripted role that is 3,500 years old,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
is very well preserved and contains 880 medical treatment procedures.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The descriptions of it are from ancient Egypt.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The role has a total length of 18 meters,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
was once cut for conservatory reasons and is now digitized

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and put together again on our website.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It is also callable by TIFF.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I will show briefly how this works and also present the quality of the representation.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000
This is the entire scripted role, which does not exist physically anymore.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:37.000
The digital field is 145,000 pixels wide and 3,000 pixels high and is still easily zoomed in.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:47.000
In addition, we have also translated the medical recipes,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
so that you can also look over here which medical procedures for which fractures were used.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
For safety, I have this as a slide, I will skip that now.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Example 2, the Codex Sinaiticus is a Bible manuscript from the 4th century,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:16.000
which is considered to be the first Bible manuscript that contains the complete New Testament

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and is distributed today in four institutions.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
The largest part is in the British Library in London,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
a smaller part is here in the University Library in Leipzig,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
the National Library in Russia and the St. Catherine's Monastery in Egypt

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
also have smaller parts of the Codex.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
This is a perfect use case for TIFF to bring the entire work

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
together in one presentation and then make it platterable.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
However, this can be topped by the fact that there is a second Bible manuscript

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
which is about the same age as the Codex Vaticanus,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
which is in the Vatican and the nice thing is that the leaves,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
at least the Leipzig leaves of the Codex Sinaiticus, are provided by us as TIFF

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and the Vatican leaves are also provided by the Vatican libraries as TIFF.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Now I can show you how it is possible to collect digitalized works from different institutions

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000
in a TIFF-compatible surface, which you can also set up yourself.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I will first take the Codex Sinaiticus from Leipzig and load the manifest file

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:14.000
of the Codex Vaticanus into this surface and open this view here in the Mirador Viewer

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and can now show the digitalized works side by side through this relatively comfortable option.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
In fact, as a researcher, I demonstrate this prominent example,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:38.000
that I collect digitalized works from very different institutions individually in my research environment.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I will now call up the same place, the beginning of the book Esther,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and as a full-time researcher in this field, it is obvious that it is about the same content.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Let's continue. Here again the picture of the two digitalized works being distributed

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
in this moment by different repositories.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Example number three is a demo that can be found in the official demo system of the Mirador project.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I will close this other object here. It shows a manuscript from France,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:48.000
which has been cut out of an illustration.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
This illustration is obviously found in another institution today.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000
The data model of IIIF, the institution-based, also allows digitalized works from different institutions

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
to be brought together on the same canvas, as I showed earlier,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
to create the impression of the original virtually.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Because this demo system is so beautiful, I can show you shortly how it works with the annotations.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:35.000
You can call up an area here and leave an important note.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Depending on how the system is configured, this annotation can be distributed in an institutional storage,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
but it is also possible to provide researchers with working environments in the future

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000
to put their private annotations and notes on the works they are working on.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Here I made another cutout, showing how the two different digitalized works are displayed in the manifest file.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:25.000
If you look at the URL, you can see that the different image servers can be put together on the canvas.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
That was a mistake.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I can give you an example. We have tried this technology practically this year.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
There is a monthly manuscript course at the University Library of Leipzig.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:51.000
This year, we provided a virtual working environment for the participants

00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:02.000
where they could work virtually with our own manuscripts, but also with manuscripts from other institutions.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Then they put annotations together in groups and created them together with the manuscripts.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
This way, they were able to document their research results together.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.000
This was based on a software provided by the Stanford University Libraries, which is also freely available.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The Mirador Viewer, which I showed earlier, has been expanded again.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
I would also like to introduce a small private project, as a start-up announcement.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:54.000
I used Wikidata and the use of Sparkle Endpoints to pull up high resolution pictures of paintings, drawings and cards

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000
on my own server and converted them into 3D.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I have prepared them and made them searchable.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.000
This system allows you to search for this digitalization.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I can also show the track and drop feature, which is often used or recommended for the integration or connection of discovery systems

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
with image presentation systems, in which these data can be retrieved.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:50.000
The 3D manifest files are also used to retrieve the data from other workspaces.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
A very small selection of data is also possible.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Many important institutions have digitalized 3D online, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the French National Library.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:16.000
There is also a manual portal in Switzerland, which contains the important manuals of the Swiss institutions.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
All of this is also 3D compatible.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Here are the links. If you are interested, you can look for this later in the PDF.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
The Welcome Library also has large image storage.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Archive Org supports 3D as well.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:47.000
These are just examples of large data pools that you can access to realize your own presentation or other projects that you want to implement with this data.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
The 3Dif APIs are of course developing further.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:05.000
The presentation API version 3.0 is to be released shortly, which will provide a change in the data models in relation to annotations

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and on the other hand also provide support for video data.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Institutional, two words about the University Library of Leipzig. We have adopted an Open Digitalization Policy

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:33.000
in order to make the digitalized data in our house under CC0 or CCPDMark freely available.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:43.000
This is also possible in this institutionally compatible way.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:56.000
You can look into our digitalization workshop, where you can see the last 20 digitalized data that have been sent through our digitalization workflow.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:10.000
We will soon conduct a hackathon in Leipzig, from which we will also organize a 3Dif workshop.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I thank you very much for your attention. If you want to know more about 3Dif, you can find out about it at www.3if.io.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.000
My contact details are also listed here. Thank you very much. If you have any questions, we will have a few minutes.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Thank you very much, Leander. We have five minutes for Q&A. If you have any questions, please ask.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I have a question for Signal Angel. Is the Internet already on the line and has questions? No questions from the Internet. Then we start with microphone 1.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Good morning. Thank you for the lecture. My question is, are there interfaces for inventory databases such as Star Text, HIDA or similar?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I can't give you a specific answer about this product, but I think 3Dif is a standardized, actually only the description of an interface standard.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Systems that are supposed to be made compatible with it should offer interfaces that realize this standard.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Thank you. Then we continue with microphone 1. My question is, this is a standard. Are there alternative standards that are also used somewhere?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:59.000
The big advantage is that if everyone uses it, the different institutions do it. But if the library starts to use other standards in Berlin, it might be a bit bad.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:08.000
My question is, is it used in the general library scene or is there a competitive standard?

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:17.000
There is actually an older competitive standard. It is based on XML files.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:39.000
The data is usually delivered as complete images, but on this technological standard, this dynamic delivery on a Kachel basis, the basis on linked data technologies, is, in my knowledge, so competitive at the moment.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Wonderful. Thank you very much. Are there any other questions? Has the internet been reported by now? They are still sleeping. Did they have a party as well as we did?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Well, there is no one else standing on the microphones. Then I would say thank you very much, Clarenda. Thank you.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Thank you.
