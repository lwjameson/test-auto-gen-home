And in her upcoming collection, which I've not read but I'm already recommending, it's called Praise the Daughter Who Raised, uh Who Raised Herself With the Voice in Her Head or something like that. Anything Warsan writes read it. Um Claudia Rankine, Citizen. The list is endless. But you can reach out to me offline, and I will chat with you some more."
