And I I notice that both of your works deal with the silencing of women in society, of female invisibility, commodification, and trafficking and objectification of women. And uh how that can call attention to the tragic plight off the the girl tried, women caught up in global sex trade, as we see in Merchants of Flesh. Or even women caught up in an affair of the legal or justice system as Ifeoma depicts in Waiting for Maria."
