line:84%\nActually, my first\nquestion is unplanned\n\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%\nbecause it's\nsomething that I just\n\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%\nlearned right at the beginning\nof this event, which is--\n\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%\nDavid, would you\nlike to tell us.\n\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.780

line:84%\nAnd you asked, are these\nThomas Hart Benton?\n\n00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:90%\nAnd why did you ask that?\n\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:90%\nWhat prompted you?\n\n00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Because\nI recognized his style.\n\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%\nAnd a wonderful story about\nHarry S.

while\nHarry was still alive.\n\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we have\nwonderful photographs\n\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%\nin the Library of

00:09:24.810 align:middle line:90%\nIt's still there.\n\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So my first\nquestion, essentially,\n\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%\nwas to ask you about being\nthe archivist of the United\n\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%\nStates, which later\nI'm going to follow up\n\n00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%\nto ask you to explain to the\naudience what a Presidential\n\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:90%\nLibrary is.\n\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:84%\nBut first let me ask you--\njust for our general crowd--\n\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%\ncan you explain a\nlittle bit of what\n\n00:09:45.540 -->

00:09:55.443 align:middle line:84%\nOr in library\nschool, I'm assuming.\n\n00:09:55.443 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Forget that.\n\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah, forget that.\n\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.360 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHS]\n\n00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.235 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO:

how does one become the\nArchivist of the United States.\n\n00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Well there was\nthis ad in the New York Times.\n\n00:10:48.520 -->

Library\n\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%\nand what looks like a very\ncushy job from this perspective.\n\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:84%\nI had a wonderful\noffice on Fifth Avenue\n\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:90%\nwith a lion outside my window.\n\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI:

--> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%\nMy assistant came in\nand said the White\n\n00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:90%\nHouse is on the phone.\n\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.672 align:middle line:90%\nSo I got on the phone.\n\n00:11:25.672 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Was it April 1?\n\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID

--> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%\nSo it was like the\nmiddle of the month.\n\n00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:90%\nSo I got on the phone, Hello.\n\n00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%\nAnd this 12-year-old, who\nwas working on appointments\n\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:90%\nfor the president, said--\n\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.847 align:middle line:84%\nI guess I wasn't enthusiastic\nenough because he said--\n\n00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:84%\naren't you surprised to be\ngetting a call from the White\n\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:90%\nHouse?\n\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.493 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle

00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%\nthat, I'm calling\nbecause we're looking\n\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%\nat for the position of\narchivist of the United States.\n\n00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%\nSo this is a\npresidential appointment.\n\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:84%\nAnd my sense of things\nat that point-- and even\n\n00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%\nnow-- is that presidential\nappointments are usually\n\n00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%\nsomeone who gave a lot of\nmoney to the campaign that\n\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:84%\nelected the president, or is\na friend of the president,\n\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle

why on Earth are\nyou calling me--\n\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%\n--who knows the\nbusiness and

00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Did you\nactually ask him that?\n\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.912 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No.\n\n00:12:35.912 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%\nI said, I'm very\nflattered, but you're\n\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%\nlooking at the wrong\nperson and made it clear\n\n00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%\nthat this was the end\nof the conversation.\n\n00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he said, well,\nwould you think about it\n\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:84%\nover the weekend, and\nwe'll talk again on Monday.\n\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:90%\nAnd I said, sure.\n\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.045 align:middle line:90%\nSo he called Monday morning.\n\n00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we had the\nsame conversation.\n\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:84%\nAnd 10 minutes later\nan adult called.\n\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:84%\nThe poor kid, Kyle Watkins, was\nan

00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%\nof calling me to tell me all\nthis, and I treated him poorly.\n\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:84%\nSo 10 minutes later\nan adult called\n\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%\nand asked if he could\ncome to New York\n\n00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:90%\nand talk to me about the job.\n\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:84%\nAnd that week Tom\nWheeler, who turned out\n\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%\nto be the director\nof the FCC later,\n\n00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%\ncame and talked about what\nthe president was looking\n\n00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.500

line:84%\nWelcome to the IU\nlibraries, everyone.\n\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: But there\nhas been, historically,\n\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%\na lot of, I wouldn't\nsay tension,\n\n00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:84%\nbut difference among the\nlibrarians and archivists.\n\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:90%\nIt's the same business, please.\n\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%\nIt's the same business.\n\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.843 align:middle line:84%\nCollect, protect, encourage\nthe use of, fill in the blank.\n\n00:14:39.843 --> 00:14:40.635 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%\nSo you were nominated\nfor the position\n\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:90%\nby President Barack Obama.\n\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.\n\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: But you served\nunder President Obama,\n\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%\nPresident Trump, and\nthen President Biden.\n\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:90%\nSo you've kind of--\n\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.323 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It's a\nlifetime appointment.\n\n00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%\nThere is no term for the\narchivists in the United\n\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:90%\nStates.\n\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%\nSo at the end of\nan administration\n\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%\nthere are 4,000\npresidential appointments.\n\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:84%\nAnd at the end of\nan administration\n\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%\n4,000 people leave.\n\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.900 align:middle line:84%\nAnd so if you have a\npresidential appointment,\n\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%\nyou get a notice from\nthe incoming president\n\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%\nasking you to submit\nyour resignation,\n\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%\nexcept the archivist\ndoesn't get that notice.\n\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh, well,\nthat's a job perk.\n\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.127 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Right.\n\n00:15:23.127 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So one\nof the huge challenges\n\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%\nfor the National\nArchives is to ensure\n\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:84%\nthat those 4,000\npeople who are leaving\n\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%\nare leaving their\nrecords behind.\n\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Right.\n\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And\nmore challenging\n\n00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%\nis to ensure that those\n4,000 people coming in\n\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.947 align:middle line:90%\nknow what the rules are.\n\n00:15:39.947 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Right.\n\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%\nSo you kind of touched\non this a little bit,\n\n00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.385 align:middle line:90%\nbut you were nominated in--\n\n00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%\nI think it was July\nof 2009, correct?\n\n00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you were confirmed-- so\nall presidential appointments\n\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%\nhave to be vetted by the\nUnited States Senate.\n\n00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:90%\nThere are confirmation hearings.\n\n00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%\nSome of you might have\nwatched them on CNN or c-span.\n\n00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.353 align:middle line:84%\nSo everyone has to go\nthrough the whole grilling\n\n00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:90%\nprocess of having a hearing.\n\n00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Very Invasive.\n\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Right, and\nso you were actually--\n\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:84%\nI think that you were\nnominated in July of 2009\n\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:90%\nand then confirmed in November.\n\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.020 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: November\n\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So essentially\nthree months later.\n\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Right\n\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.053 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: The current\nArchivist of the United States\n\n00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:84%\nwas nominated in, I\nthink, August of 2022\n\n00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%\nand wasn't confirmed\nuntil May of 2023.\n\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%\nSo it took nine months\nto get her confirmed.\n\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:90%\nSo what is that process like?\n\n00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%\nWhat is it like to be nominated\nand go through that kind of--\n\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: As I\nsaid, it's very invasive.\n\n00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.180 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%\nSo when Tom left\nmy office, he said,\n\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.860 align:middle line:84%\nwould you come to Washington\nand talk some more?\n\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%\nAnd that's when I met\nwith the full committee\n\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%\nat the White House and\ntalked about the job.\n\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%\nAnd as I was leaving\nthe room, David Jacobson\n\n00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:90%\nwho was the head of that--\n\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%\nWho was Kyle's boss said, so can\nwe consider you our candidate.\n\n00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:90%\nAnd I said, yes.\n\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%\nAnd at that point\nit was locked down.\n\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:84%\nI couldn't talk to\nanyone except my wife\n\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%\nabout what was going on.\n\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%\nAnd that launched an\ninvestigative process.\n\n00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:84%\nFBI agents spread out\nacross the country talking\n\n00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:90%\nto anyone I ever had known.\n\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I kept getting these emails\nfrom folks, friends saying,\n\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:90%\nwhat the hell is going on?\n\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:90%\nThe FBI is at my door.\n\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh no.\n\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:84%\nThat is not what\nyou want to hear.\n\n00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.745 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nAll they can tell\n\n00:17:43.745 --> 00:17:45.742 align:middle line:84%\nme is that it's not a\ncriminal investigation.\n\n00:17:45.742 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:90%\nThanks, yeah.\n\n00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So I\npassed those tests.\n\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%\nAnd then the next\nphase is you have\n\n00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:84%\nto meet with every member\nof the Senate Committee\n\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:90%\nthat's voting on you.\n\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%\nSo a White House\nshepherd and I visited\n\n00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:90%\neach member of the committee.\n\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:84%\nAnd my favorite visit was\nwith an unnamed Senator who\n\n00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.257 align:middle line:90%\nasked me the killer question.\n\n00:18:15.257 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Which state?\n\n00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: I'm not even\ngoing to mention the state.\n\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.375 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: I'm just kidding.\n\n00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHS]\n\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.843 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: They asked\nme the killer question,\n\n00:18:20.843 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%\nso why is it that you want to\nbe the architect of the United\n\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:90%\nStates?\n\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:24.998 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:18:24.998 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.508 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you said, because I\nlike domes and columns.\n\n00:18:32.508 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No, I\npretended he said archivist\n\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%\nand I talked about his\nrecords, his papers.\n\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%\nAnd as we were leaving, the\nshepherd turned to me and said,\n\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:90%\ndid he say architect?\n\n00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.088 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Because there is\nan archivist-- or architect.\n\n00:18:47.088 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Of the Capitol.\n\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.588 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Of the Capitol.\n\n00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:90%\nRight, so.\n\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Not architect\nof the United States.\n\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: No,no,no.\n\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%\nNo architect of\nthe United States.\n\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:90%\nSo.\n\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.670 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So\nthen as a hearing.\n\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I think I'm\nthe last person who\n\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.708 align:middle line:84%\nhad a swift appointment and\nthen a vote by the full Senate.\n\n00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.292 align:middle line:90%\nYou know, because--\n\n00:19:08.292 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: But as\nyou've seen recently,\n\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%\nany member of the Senate could\nput a hold on a nomination.\n\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah\n\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And Lamar\nAlexander of Tennessee\n\n00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.245 align:middle line:90%\nput a hold on my nomination.\n\n00:19:20.245 --> 00:19:21.120 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Really?\n\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.\n\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.015 align:middle line:84%\nThe White House\ncouldn't figure out--\n\n00:19:24.015 --> 00:19:25.890 align:middle line:84%\nnobody could figure out\nwhat the problem was.\n\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%\nSo they sent me to meet with\nLamar, who was very embarrassed\n\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:90%\nthat he had put a hold on it.\n\n00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%\nBut it turns out that\none of his constituents\n\n00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:84%\nreported that the director\nof the Nixon Library\n\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.970 align:middle line:84%\nwas saying some pretty\nanti-Nixon things,\n\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%\nand he thought I\nshould know about that.\n\n00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%\nAnd once he got\nthat off the table,\n\n00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%\nthen we had a wonderful\nconversation about his--\n\n00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%\nhe used to be a president of\nthe University of Tennessee.\n\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%\nSo we talked about\nhigher education.\n\n00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:84%\nHe really embarrassed\nbecause his wife, Honey,\n\n00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%\nwas on the National\nArchives Foundation board.\n\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Ooh-ho-ho.\n\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So she\nwasn't happy about him\n\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%\nputting a hold on it.\n\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%\nSo as soon as I left the\noffice, they lifted the hold.\n\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:18.748 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I think it was the last\nunanimous vote on a nomination.\n\n00:20:18.748 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:90%\nWell, yeah.\n\n00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:84%\nBecause, like I said, the\ncurrent Archivist of the United\n\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:90%\nStates, it was very con--\n\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:90%\nNot, I think, because of her.\n\n00:20:28.190 -->

the Hill in terms of\nthe non-partisan approach\n\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:90%\nto everything.\n\n00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Right.\n\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:90%\nSo just to clarify for everyone.\n\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%\nSo you essentially\nare the director\n\n00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%\nand the head of the\nNational Archives, right.\n\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%\nTechnically the National\nArchives and Records\n\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:90%\nAdministration.\n\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I kind of, and\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\n\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%\nbut I think part\nof the reason why\n\n00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:84%\nthere is such an invasive\nprocess for vetting\n\n00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%\nthe potential Archivist\nof the United States,\n\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%\nand sending the FBI, and finding\nout everything from everyone\n\n00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%\nwho ever knew you is because\nyou have access to some really\n\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:90%\nimportant documents.\n\n00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.867 align:middle line:90%\nNo is this not--\n\n00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:19.492 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: The\nprocess is the same\n\n00:21:19.492 --> 00:21:20.867 align:middle line:84%\nfor any presidential\nappointment.\n\n00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:21.825 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh, Yeah.\n\n00:21:21.825 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:90%\nWell no, I know that.\n\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.420 align:middle line:84%\nBut I guess it's\nthis idea that they\n\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:84%\ndon't want anyone, any\npresidential appointment,\n\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%\nto be in a position\nto be blackmailed--\n\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Oh yeah, sure.\n\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.977 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: --or to\nhave something over you,\n\n00:21:32.977 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%\nor be able to leak documents,\nor do anything like this.\n\n00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:84%\nAnd in your case, with\nthe National Archives,\n\n00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%\nthis is the home of\nall of the founding\n\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:90%\ndocuments of this country.\n\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.350

80 people.\n\n00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%\nWe started on a\nSaturday night evening.\n\n00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%\nWe had a whole evening full\nof

they brought sleeping\nbags and stuff to sleep.\n\n00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:90%\nAnd lights out at 11 o'clock.\n\n00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%\nAnd they

so--\n\n00:23:14.938 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the way I\nunderstand it is, that\n\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%\nwas part of a very important\ninitiative to you, which\n\n00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:26.810 align:middle line:84%\nwas to make the collections\nof the National Archives\n\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:90%\naccessible to people.\n\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%\nAnd invite the public in\nand kind of break down\n\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.905 align:middle line:90%\nthat barrier.\n\n00:23:33.905 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:90%\nSo was that a part of that?\n\n00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It was a\npiece of the open government\n\n00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%\ninitiative where we\nwere trying to make\n\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:84%\neach agency more\nuser responsive,\n\n00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.366

Yeah.\n\n00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%\nAnd so the National\nArchives, like I said,\n\n00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:84%\nhas these founding documents\nof the country in it.\n\n00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it has things like the\nEmancipation Proclamation\n\n00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.083 align:middle line:84%\nand the Treaty of

00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Not\nmy problem anymore.\n\n00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.018 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Right, exactly.\n\n00:25:05.018 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:90%\nNot your problem anymore.\n\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.493 align:middle line:90%\nSo what else?\n\n00:25:08.493 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:84%\nI mean, what are some\nof your favorite things.\n\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.600 align:middle line:84%\nLike, what other\ncollections are there\n\n00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:84%\nbesides federal records,\nand Presidential Records,\n\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.102 align:middle line:84%\nand official records,\nbut what else is there?\n\n00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: A\ncouple of things.\n\n00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%\nOne of one of my favorite\nparts of the collection\n\n00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%\nare the treaties that we\nsigned with Native nations.\n\n00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%\nSo there are 375 of them which\nhave been digitized and are now\n\n00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:90%\nup and available on our website.\n\n00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%\nThey're the saddest documents,\nI think, in our collection.\n\n00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%\nBecause they spell\nout everything\n\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%\nthat we promised to the\nIndians while we grabbed\n\n00:25:48.540 -->

00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%\nwho are working on federal cases\non land reuse and water rights.\n\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%\nSo that's one piece\nof the collection.\n\n00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%\nBut there's another\npiece too that I would\n\n00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:90%\nput in the favorite category.\n\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%\nWhen I became the\narchivist and met\n\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.475 align:middle line:84%\nwith the directors of the\nPresidential Libraries\n\n00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%\nfor the first time, they\nwent around the room\n\n00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:90%\nand introduced themselves.\n\n00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the director of\nthe Kennedy handed me\n\n00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%\na copy of a letter that a\nkid

who\nlives in North Carolina.\n\n00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%\nAnd his advice to me was,\nwhen you talk to David,\n\n00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:84%\nyou might ask him about\nsome of the artifacts he\n\n00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:84%\nhad in his office,\nincluding a letter\n\n00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.115 align:middle line:90%\nhe wrote to LBJ and perhaps--\n\n00:27:11.115 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Facsimiles.\n\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.698 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI:\nFacsimiles, for sure.\n\n00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:90%\nFor sure.\n\n00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:90%\nBut I thought this was a great--\n\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%\nthat these letters\nwere from you.\n\n00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you found them\nin the archives,\n\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%\nwhich struck me\nbecause, essentially,\n\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%\nwe, as citizens,\nare in the archives.\n\n00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%\nIt is not just for\nPresidential Records\n\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:90%\nand of course, it is for that.\n\n00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:84%\nBut we're all in\nit, essentially.\n\n00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.492 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: One of the\nactivities for the sleepover\n\n00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:84%\nis kids get an\nopportunity to write\n\n00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:90%\na letter to the president.\n\n00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.380 align:middle line:90%\nAnd we deliver them.\n\n00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.588 align:middle line:84%\nOn Monday morning we deliver\nthem to the White House,\n\n00:27:45.588 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:90%\nand President Obama responded.\n\n00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Awe.\n\n00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%\nThat reminds me\nactually of, in 2018,\n\n00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%\nwhen I had an\nopportunity to visit\n\n00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:84%\nRichard Lugar at\nhis office, and I\n\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:90%\nhad my picture taken with him.\n\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:84%\nAnd in the mail I\ngot a signed copy.\n\n00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I said, do I\nhave to archive this?\n\n00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.305 align:middle line:90%\nLike, I have this picture.\n\n00:28:09.305 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: [LAUGHS]\n\n00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: But\nI've also read things,\n\n00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%\nwhere for instance, the\nNational Archives has veterans\n\n00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:90%\nrecords and military records.\n\n00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you, yourself,\nare a veteran, right.\n\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%\nAnd there were several blog\nposts about the 1950 census\n\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:84%\nwhich was recently\nreleased, and people\n\n00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.320 align:middle line:84%\nwho found their relatives\nonline, or found\n\n00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:90%\ntheir parents in the census.\n\n00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%\nSo essentially, again, we're\nall in the National Archives.\n\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.\n\n00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%\nSo when I visited Saint Louis,\nwhere our military records are,\n\n00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.820 align:middle line:84%\nthere's a special vault\nfor high-end veterans.\n\n00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%\nRecords that we want make\nsure we want to make sure\n\n00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:59.520 align:middle line:90%\naren't tampered or messed up.\n\n00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:84%\nNot that there's a\nlot of that goes on.\n\n00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:90%\nBut the VIP vaults.\n\n00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:84%\nSo they took me on a\ntour of the VIP vault\n\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.222 align:middle line:84%\nand handed me Elvis's\nservice record.\n\n00:29:09.222 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:90%\nAnd was it?\n\n00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.502 align:middle line:84%\nOh Yeah, so I think\nthat recently--\n\n00:29:17.502 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:84%\nand I want to see if\nthis is still true--\n\n00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%\nbut recently we watched a\nprogram from the New York\n\n00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%\nHistorical Society\nthat was an interview\n\n00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%\nwith the current Archivist\nof the United States, Colleen\n\n00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:27.570 align:middle line:90%\nShogan.\n\n00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:84%\nAnd she was asked\nthe question of what\n\n00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%\nis the most requested\nand popular item.\n\n00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%\nAnd she said it was\nthe photograph of Elvis\n\n00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.667 align:middle line:90%\nwith President Richard Nixon.\n\n00:29:36.667 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yes.\n\n00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Is that?\n\n00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nIt's a great story.\n\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah?\n\n00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: You\nwant to hear it?\n\n00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Absolutely.\n\n00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: OK.\n\n00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.922 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Do\nyou want to hear it?\n\n00:29:42.922 --> 00:29:44.220 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So\nElvis collected badges.\n\n00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he had badges from\nall over the country.\n\n00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the one that he really\nwanted was an FBI badge,\n\n00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%\nand the FBI refused\nto give him a badge.\n\n00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%\nSo he took it upon himself\nto fly from Los Angeles--\n\n00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:90%\nhe was on the West Coast.\n\n00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.710 align:middle line:84%\nHe flew to Washington\non American Airlines\n\n00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.700 align:middle line:84%\nbecause he asked the flight\nattendant for stationery\n\n00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%\nto write a letter\nto President Nixon,\n\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%\nasking to meet with him\nbecause he wanted to volunteer\n\n00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.440 align:middle line:90%\nfor his war on drugs.\n\n00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.030 align:middle line:90%\nNothing about badges.\n\n00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.350 align:middle line:90%\nNothing about badges.\n\n00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.250 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And he and he\ngot into a cab at the airport\n\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%\nand got delivered\nto the West Wing\n\n00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.005 align:middle line:84%\ngate, where he handed the\nletter in, which you can't do.\n\n00:30:43.005 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:90%\nThey won't accept anything.\n\n00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%\nSo don't try and leave a letter\nat the gate at the White House.\n\n00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.910 align:middle line:90%\nAnd it ended up in Bud Krogh--\n\n00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.220 align:middle line:84%\nBud Krogh, who\nwas chief of Staff\n\n00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:84%\nto President Nixon\nand a huge Elvis fan.\n\n00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:90%\nIt ended up in his hands.\n\n00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:84%\nAnd sure enough, Elvis was\ninvited, that afternoon,\n\n00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.570 align:middle line:84%\nto come and to visit\nwith the president.\n\n00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:90%\nBud did a program with us.\n\n00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:84%\nAnd if you google Bud Krogh\nElvis National Archives,\n\n00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:84%\nyou can watch this\nwonderful conversation\n\n00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.840 align:middle line:84%\nwith Bud telling\nthe story of Nixon\n\n00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.550 align:middle line:84%\nnot really knowing\nwho Elvis was.\n\n00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:84%\nAnd do I really have\nto meet with him?\n\n00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:90%\nAnd all of this.\n\n00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:84%\nThere wasn't any conversation\nabout drugs or anything\n\n00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%\nin this one on one\nwith the president,\n\n00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:84%\nbut he got to the point\nwhere he wanted a badge.\n\n00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.830 align:middle line:84%\nHe really wanted an FBI badge,\nso he asked Nixon for it.\n\n00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%\nAnd Nixon turned to Bud\nand said, can I do that?\n\n00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:84%\nAnd Bud Krogh says,\nof course you can.\n\n00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:90%\nYou're the president.\n\n00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.725 align:middle line:90%\nSo guess what?\n\n00:31:50.725 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Did he\nget the FBI badge?\n\n00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: He\ngot the FBI badge.\n\n00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.340 align:middle line:84%\nAnd then Bud tells\nthe story of--\n\n00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:90%\nthis is true of every president.\n\n00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:84%\nThe resolute desk\nhas a bottom drawer\n\n00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%\nfull of gifts that the\npresident gives to visitors\n\n00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.160 align:middle line:84%\nand they're arranged\nin priority order,\n\n00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.320 align:middle line:84%\nfor the cheap stuff at the front\nand the really expensive stuff\n\n00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:90%\nat the back.\n\n00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:84%\nSo Nixon said to Elvis, I\nwant to give you a gift.\n\n00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.850 align:middle line:84%\nSo Elvis got up out of\nhis chair and went around\n\n00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%\nthe back of the desk instead\nof waiting for the president.\n\n00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:90%\nAnd he goes and pulls up--\n\n00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:84%\nI forget what he pulled\nout-- but went right\n\n00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:84%\nto the back of the\ndrawer and pulled out\n\n00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.362 align:middle line:90%\nthe most expensive stuff.\n\n00:32:30.362 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: The good stuff.\n\n00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.270 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHS]\n\n00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So we have the\nletter in the Nixon Library.\n\n00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%\nWe have the letter that Elvis\nwrote and wonderful pictures.\n\n00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.850 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the picture is on shower\ncurtains, coffee mugs.\n\n00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:90%\nIt's on T-shirts, sweatshirts.\n\n00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:90%\nIt's on everything.\n\n00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.600 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And so\nalong those lines,\n\n00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%\nwhere do Presidential records\nand Presidential papers\n\n00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.430 align:middle line:90%\nfit in to all of this?\n\n00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:08.260 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: As of 1978,\nbecause President Nixon\n\n00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:84%\nconsidered his papers\nprivate, not public--\n\n00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:90%\nand the whole Watergate thing--\n\n00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.610 align:middle line:84%\nCongress decided we need\nto codify this and make\n\n00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%\nit clear that Presidential\nrecords are public records.\n\n00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.430 align:middle line:84%\nSo they belong to the\nfederal government.\n\n00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the way it\nworks is the records\n\n00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:84%\nare maintained in\nthe White House\n\n00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:90%\nduring the administration.\n\n00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.650 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it isn't until\nthe inauguration\n\n00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:84%\nof the new president,\nduring that ceremony,\n\n00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%\nthat the records are transferred\nto the National Archives.\n\n00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.718 align:middle line:84%\nThey stay in the White\nHouse until then.\n\n00:33:48.718 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So you kind of\ntouched on it a little bit\n\n00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.640 align:middle line:84%\nabout the personal ownership\nversus the public ownership,\n\n00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:90%\nbecause for centuries--\n\n00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%\nI mean 1 and 1/2\ncenturies, 150 years--\n\n00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.822 align:middle line:84%\nPresidential papers were\nconsidered personal property.\n\n00:34:03.822 --> 00:34:06.280 align:middle

line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Library of\nCongress has a lot of them.\n\n00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%\nBut it wasn't until\nFDR, actually,\n\n00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:84%\nwho had the first\nPresidential Library.\n\n00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:84%\nI'm convinced that FDR\nwas a closet archivist,\n\n00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.469 align:middle line:90%\nbecause he really paid--\n\n00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.060 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: There are a lot\nof them out there, actually.\n\n00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.143 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: I know it.\n\n00:34:23.143 --> 00:34:25.330 align:middle line:84%\nHe really paid attention\nto organization.\n\n00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he actually-- you probably\ndon't know this-- but,\n\n00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:84%\nyou archivists, he created\nthe prototype phase box\n\n00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:35.675 align:middle line:84%\nthat you now store\nyour records in.\n\n00:34:35.675 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Really?\n\n00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It\nwasn't with acid free--\n\n00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.580 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: The archivists\nare really excited about this.\n\n00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.097 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It wasn't with\nacid free paper or anything,\n\n00:34:43.097 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:90%\nbut it's the same box.\n\n00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.460 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: I read\nan interesting thing.\n\n00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.610 align:middle line:84%\nSo I want to touch on this issue\nof the Presidential Libraries,\n\n00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.300 align:middle line:84%\nbecause you mentioned\nit with Truman.\n\n00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.842 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you've talked\nabout a little bit.\n\n00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:55.130 align:middle line:84%\nBut a little tidbit that\nI found out about FDR,\n\n00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.800 align:middle line:84%\nso Franklin Roosevelt\nwas the first president\n\n00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%\nto start a Presidential\nLibrary, right.\n\n00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.240 align:middle line:84%\nSo it's to look at\neverything and say, Wow, I've\n\n00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:90%\ngot a lot of cool stuff.\n\n00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:84%\nI should make it accessible\nto the American people.\n\n00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%\nAnd so he established\na library and a museum.\n\n00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he had tons of gifts,\nand memorabilia, and chairs,\n\n00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.390 align:middle line:90%\nand I don't know what.\n\n00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.420 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the archivist who was\nworking with him said, do you\n\n00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.943 align:middle line:90%\nreally need all of this?\n\n00:35:18.943 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:84%\nDo you really want to put\nall of this in the museum?\n\n00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he said, if people\nare going to pay a quarter\n\n00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.950 align:middle line:84%\nto come to this library,\nthey need to see some stuff.\n\n00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:90%\nThey're paying a quarter.\n\n00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:84%\nBut could you talk a little\nbit about what a Presidential\n\n00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.010 align:middle line:84%\nLibrary is versus the\nPresidential Records\n\n00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.527 align:middle line:84%\nthat go into the\nNational Archives\n\n00:35:38.527 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:90%\nand what that system looks like.\n\n00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nIt's a combination.\n\n00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:90%\nIt's artifacts and records.\n\n00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:84%\nSo state gifts and lots of\ngifts from the American public\n\n00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:84%\nall become part of-- those\nare considered records--\n\n00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.210 align:middle line:84%\nand become part of the museum\naspect of the Presidential\n\n00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.230 align:middle line:90%\nLibrary.\n\n00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:90%\nWe have a wonderful--\n\n00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%\nthe largest collection of\nmacaroni paintings in the world\n\n00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%\nare in our\nPresidential Libraries.\n\n00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%\nWe have every shoe that\nHillary Clinton ever wore.\n\n00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.350 align:middle line:84%\nWe have a lot of First\nLady [LAUGHS] wardrobes.\n\n00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:22.295 align:middle line:84%\nAnd Hillary Clinton is still\ndelivering shoes to the Clinton\n\n00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:23.170 align:middle line:90%\nPresidential Library.\n\n00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:90%\nVery strange collections.\n\n00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: But the\npublic can visit them.\n\n00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yes.\n\n00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.930 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And\nthey have exhibitions.\n\n00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:32.930 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.\n\n00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And you\ncan see the shoes.\n\n00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:90%\nCan you try them on though?\n\n00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No.\n\n00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.638 align:middle line:84%\nAfter I had done my\nfirst tour of all\n\n00:36:39.638 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:84%\nthe Presidential Libraries\nand seen all of these,\n\n00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:84%\nI started putting\nthings together\n\n00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.900 align:middle line:84%\nand threatened to do a first\nlady shoe exhibit from--\n\n00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.150 align:middle line:84%\nDIANE DALLIS-COMENTALE: I\nthink the Met did an exhibit\n\n00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%\non first lady dresses.\n\n00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.570 align:middle line:84%\nSo I don't know why\nyou wouldn't do shoes.\n\n00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: We\ncould do that too.\n\n00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:54.850 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yeah,\nwe could do that too.\n\n00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.790 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So one of the\nthings that you also mentioned,\n\n00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%\nthat is in the\nevent description,\n\n00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:84%\nthat I do want to talk about is\nthe theme for IU's Themester.\n\n00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:84%\nThis last Themester is\nLux et Veritas, right,\n\n00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:84%\nwhich translates\ninto light and truth.\n\n00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%\nIt's also actually part of\nthe motto on the official seal\n\n00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.810 align:middle line:90%\nof Indiana University.\n\n00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.660 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I know that when\nmy colleagues first\n\n00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:84%\nhad this idea of celebrating\nthis last Themester\n\n00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.610 align:middle line:84%\nand inviting you, they had this\nreally nice idea of shining\n\n00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:84%\nthe light of truth onto records,\nand history, and archives,\n\n00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:90%\nand things along those lines.\n\n00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.440 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you've talked\nabout open government\n\n00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.820 align:middle line:90%\nand the open government system.\n\n00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%\nCan you talk a little\nbit of what that means.\n\n00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.210 align:middle line:84%\nWhat does open government\nmean, and why is it important?\n\n00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.460 align:middle line:84%\nWhy is it an\nimportant principle?\n\n00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.370 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So in the Obama\nlanguage for open government,\n\n00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:01.880 align:middle line:84%\nit was transparency,\nparticipation,\n\n00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:90%\nand collaboration.\n\n00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:84%\nThose are the three linchpins\nof what open government means.\n\n00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.190 align:middle line:84%\nAnd for the National\nArchives, we\n\n00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.440 align:middle line:84%\ntried hard to figure\nout ways that we\n\n00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.580 align:middle line:90%\ncould fulfill that vision.\n\n00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.030 align:middle line:84%\nSo on his first day in\noffice, the president\n\n00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%\nmet with his senior staff\nand made the statement\n\n00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:84%\nthat the government doesn't\nhave all the answers,\n\n00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.110 align:middle line:84%\nand we need to figure out ways\nto engage the American public\n\n00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:90%\nin doing our work.\n\n00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:32.150 align:middle line:84%\nSo we took that very seriously\nat the National Archives\n\n00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.100 align:middle line:84%\nand worked on and\nthought about ways\n\n00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:84%\nthat we could engage\nthe public in the work\n\n00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.030 align:middle line:84%\nthat we do, which resulted in\nthe creation of the Citizen\n\n00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:84%\nArchivist project, where we have\nopportunities for the public\n\n00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:84%\nto help us, in a number of ways,\nin making access to our records\n\n00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:90%\nbetter.\n\n00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:84%\nSo, as you probably\nknow, cursive\n\n00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.030 align:middle line:84%\nisn't taught much\nin schools anymore.\n\n00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:84%\nAnd about 80% of the Federal\nRecords are in cursive.\n\n00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.800 align:middle line:84%\nSo we have kids now,\nand their parents\n\n00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.620 align:middle line:84%\nin lots of cases, who\ncan't read these records.\n\n00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.510 align:middle line:84%\nAnd in fact, I was\ntalking to a couple\n\n00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%\nof adults last night who\ncouldn't read records,\n\n00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.287 align:middle line:90%\ncouldn't read cursive.\n\n00:39:13.287 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Or even\nfrom the 19th century,\n\n00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.030 align:middle line:84%\neven if you can read cursive,\nit's a different kind\n\n00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:90%\nand it's--\n\n00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Don't\ngive me any excuses.\n\n00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.747 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: OK, all right.\n\n00:39:21.747 --> 00:39:22.482 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:23.190 align:middle line:90%\nI take that back.\n\n00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.990 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So we\nhave loaded thousands\n\n00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.510 align:middle line:84%\nof records in the Citizen\nArchivist Dashboard\n\n00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.700 align:middle line:84%\nand you can go in and\ntranscribe for us.\n\n00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.620 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we've got folks\nfrom, actually,\n\n00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.750 align:middle line:84%\naround the world who are\nparticipating in this.\n\n00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.790 align:middle line:84%\nAnd to date, we have I think\nthe figure is something\n\n00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:44.655 align:middle line:84%\nlike 250 million transcriptions\nhave been done of our records.\n\n00:39:44.655 --> 00:39:47.280 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And this is just,\nwhen you say Citizen Archivist,\n\n00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.260 align:middle line:84%\nthis is just people,\njust the public.\n\n00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.350 align:middle line:84%\nWell, I mean, these are not\nnecessarily employees of NARA.\n\n00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.142 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: There's\na wonderful nursing\n\n00:39:57.142 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%\nhome in Massachusetts that\nhas adopted this project.\n\n00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.472 align:middle line:84%\nAnd they do they\ndo transcriptions.\n\n00:40:01.472 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So this\nis for anyone who's\n\n00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.130 align:middle line:90%\ninterested in getting involved.\n\n00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.270 align:middle line:90%\nIs it still going?\n\n00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.470 align:middle line:90%\nCan people still get in--\n\n00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.920 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Oh Yeah\n\n00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: How they get\ninvolved in the project?\n\n00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.557 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Archives.gov\n\n00:40:10.557 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Archives.gov OK.\n\n00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:84%\nDo you do crowdsourcing\nlike, with photographs?\n\n00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Oh\nyeah, we do that.\n\n00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.300 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.587 align:middle line:84%\nThere are several\ndifferent options.\n\n00:40:19.587 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:90%\nYou can do transcriptions.\n\n00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:90%\nYou can tag photos.\n\n00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%\nAs I said, we have 43\nmillion photographs\n\n00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:90%\nand not very well described.\n\n00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.180 align:middle line:84%\nSo we've loaded\nthousands of photographs\n\n00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:84%\nwhere people are tagging people\nthat they recognize, or places\n\n00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:84%\nif they recognize, or whatever\ninformation they might\n\n00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.040 align:middle line:90%\nhave about the photograph.\n\n00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.200 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So what\nis the result of this.\n\n00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:84%\nHow many people have been\ninvolved as Citizen

have been--\n\n00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.103 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: How's the quality?\n\n00:40:53.103 --> 00:40:55.320 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: I can't\ngive you numbers of people.\n\n00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:84%\nBut we've been very\npleased with the quality\n\n00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.800 align:middle line:84%\nof the transcriptions\nand each one\n\n00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.680 align:middle line:84%\nis checked to make sure\nthat it's accurate.\n\n00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:84%\nAnother way that we've focused\non-- this came up in my meeting\n\n00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:90%\nwith the students today.\n\n00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.220 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:84%\nEvery attempt is to make our\ncontent accessible in any way\n\n00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.500 align:middle line:90%\nwe possibly can.\n\n00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:25.040 align:middle line:84%\nSo we've devoted a lot of work,\ntime, and effort on Wikipedia.\n\n00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.790 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah\n\n00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.415 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Hired the first\nfederal Wikipedian in residence\n\n00:41:28.415 --> 00:41:31.400 align:middle line:84%\nwas part of the\nNational Archives staff,\n\n00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:84%\nwho had the dual role of\nhelping us create those links\n\n00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:84%\nbut also educating the staff\nabout the power of Wikipedia.\n\n00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:48.380 align:middle line:84%\nSo now our processing\nfolks link record groups\n\n00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.400 align:middle line:90%\nto articles in Wikipedia.\n\n00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.030 align:middle line:84%\nAnd there are probably\nin the neighborhood\n\n00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:01.010 align:middle line:84%\nof 4,000 to 5,000\nWikipedia records that\n\n00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:84%\nhave content that have links\nfrom the National Archives.\n\n00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:13.160 align:middle

00:42:19.970 align:middle line:84%\ninitiated a huge social\nmedia initiative as well.\n\n00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.\n\n00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.980

00:42:31.550 align:middle line:84%\nI'm not even the archivist yet,\nbut I'm reading the New York\n\n00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%\nTimes and there's this article\nabout the

00:42:48.680 align:middle line:90%\nWhy aren't they all over this?\n\n00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it turns out that the\nNational Archives wasn't doing\n\n00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.860 align:middle line:90%\nanything with social media.\n\n00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:90%\nAnd this is 2009.\n\n00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.180 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I discovered that there\nwas a small group of folks\n\n00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.690 align:middle line:84%\nwho were interested\nin social media\n\n00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:09.690 align:middle

align:middle line:84%\nAnd I heard about\nthis, and I walked\n\n00:43:15.855 --> 00:43:16.980 align:middle line:90%\ninto one of their meetings.\n\n00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:84%\nAnd they thought\nthey were busted.\n\n00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.580 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.560 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we sat down and had\na great conversation.\n\n00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:84%\nAnd at that meeting I\nauthorized the purchase\n\n00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:84%\nof iPads and iPhones,\n25 to fool around.\n\n00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:90%\nAnd let's get started here.\n\n00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:45.210 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the next morning I got a\ncall from my CIO, who said,\n\n00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:84%\nI understand you want\niPads and iPhones.\n\n00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.030 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I said,

--> 00:44:18.365 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:44:18.365 --> 00:44:19.990 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nThat'll take 13 months.\n\n00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.750 align:middle line:90%\n13 months.\n\n00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.520 align:middle line:84%\nI said, no, that's\nnot good enough.\n\n00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:90%\nUh-Uh, that doesn't work for

align:middle line:84%\nwith the Indiana Daily Student,\nwhich is a student newspaper.\n\n00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.970 align:middle line:84%\nAnd she asked me a really\ninteresting question.\n\n00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:84%\nShe asked me what I found\nmost interesting or inspiring\n\n00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.190 align:middle line:90%\nabout you.\n\n00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:48.760 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I have to say that\nmy answer was actually\n\n00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.670 align:middle line:84%\nthe \"Gighy\" or\n\"Jiphy,\" depending\n\n00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:84%\non how you pronounce it, the\nGiphy Channel for the National\n\n00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:55.480 align:middle line:90%\nArchives.\n\n00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.440 align:middle line:90%\nBecause I checked it out.\n\n00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:90%\nIt's amazing.\n\n00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.350 align:middle line:84%\nThere are 1,500 JIFs\nor GIFs, depending\n\n00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:84%\non your preference,\nthat have been uploaded\n\n00:45:07.390 -->

amazing because there\nare things from World War One,\n\n00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.530 align:middle line:84%\nWorld War Two, but\nalso space exploration,\n\n00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.940 align:middle

line:84%\nBut also kids\nsledding, and holidays,\n\n00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:35.783 align:middle line:84%\nand my favorite, which is\nthe dancing dogs, Waffles\n\n00:45:35.783 --> 00:45:36.325

tutus.\n\n00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:43.240 align:middle line:84%\nAnd what I said\nwas that, to me it\n\n00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.350 align:middle line:84%\nis making the federal government\nand the National Archives\n\n00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:90%\nmore accessible.\n\n00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.290 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it is saying to\npeople, everyone's welcome.\n\n00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:58.450 align:middle line:84%\nWe're not just this imposing\nbuilding on Pennsylvania Avenue\n\n00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:59.800 align:middle line:90%\nbut we're you.\n\n00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.240 align:middle line:90%\nWe're About you.\n\n00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.970 align:middle line:84%\nSo is this kind of\nsomething that you felt--\n\n00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:84%\nhow do you feel that this\nhelped with NARA's image?\n\n00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.840 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: First of\nall, it was unleashing\n\n00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.630 align:middle line:84%\nthe talent within the\nAgency that these folks have\n\n00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.570 align:middle line:84%\nbeen dreaming about things\nto do with social media.\n\n00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:21.550 align:middle line:84%\nAs I said, in 2009 we were not\non any social media platforms.\n\n00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.440 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the argument I\nmade with the staff\n\n00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.380 align:middle line:84%\nwas, we are responsible\nfor providing\n\n00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:84%\nguidance to the agencies\nabout the records\n\n00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.130 align:middle line:84%\nimplications of their\nuse of social media.\n\n00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.430 align:middle line:84%\nAnd if we're not using\nthis stuff ourselves,\n\n00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:84%\nhow are we possibly\ngoing to do that?\n\n00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:84%\nSo we're now on 16 platforms\nand the staff is energized,\n\n00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:51.370 align:middle line:84%\nand it has spread\nto State Archives\n\n00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:55.792 align:middle line:84%\nand other archives have been\nfollowing what we're doing.\n\n00:46:55.792 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Well,\nand I noticed--\n\n00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.870 align:middle line:84%\nand we'll start\nwith the questions--\n\n00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:04.840 align:middle line:84%\nbut I also noticed that the\nTrump Presidential Library\n\n00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.638 align:middle line:90%\nhas an archive of his tweets.\n\n00:47:06.638 --> 00:47:07.930 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yes, of course.\n\n00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.860 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So social\nmedia is actually\n\n00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.010 align:middle line:84%\nan important social\nphenomenon that\n\n00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:84%\nis woven into the nation's\nhistory and the Presidential\n\n00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.350 align:middle line:90%\nRecords.\n\n00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.760 align:middle line:84%\nAll right, so now we will\nturn to y'all's questions.\n\n00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%\nSo the first one for you\nis, while we narrowly\n\n00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:84%\navoided a government shutdown,\nyou saw the National Archives\n\n00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.590 align:middle line:90%\nthrough a few shutdowns.\n\n00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:38.920 align:middle line:84%\nHow did these impact the work\nof NARA, short and long term?\n\n00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.590 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It's\na horrible situation\n\n00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:45.970 align:middle line:84%\nbecause we have no idea how long\nthe shutdown is going to last.\n\n00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:90%\nThat the staff by and large--\n\n00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.360 align:middle line:84%\nwe have, for the National\nArchives it's 3,000 people\n\n00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:57.370 align:middle line:90%\nin 42

paid,\nand they have no idea\n\n00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:90%\nhow long this is going to last.\n\n00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.920 align:middle line:84%\nFor the longer ones, and we've\nbeen through some longer ones,\n\n00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.060 align:middle line:84%\npeople have actually left\nand taken other jobs.\n\n00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:18.430 align:middle line:84%\nBut the damage it\ndoes to people feeling\n\n00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.940 align:middle line:84%\ngood about working for the\ngovernment and the damage\n\n00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.262

closet archivist.\n\n00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:27.370 align:middle line:84%\nBut he really took an\ninterest in the archives,\n\n00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.460 align:middle line:84%\nrecruited the first\narchivist, and made\n\n00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.930 align:middle line:84%\nsure that archivist got what\nhe needed in terms of support.\n\n00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:38.050 align:middle line:84%\nAnd that first archivist had\nthe job of wandering around town\n\n00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.760 align:middle line:84%\nand figuring out where\nthe records were,\n\n00:49:39.760 -->

align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.980 align:middle line:90%\nRead that again.\n\n00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.185 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh, so.\n\n00:49:58.185 --> 00:49:59.560 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nThere was a point\n\n00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:84%\nI was trying to make with\n[LAUGHS] why we had to go

00:50:10.990 align:middle line:84%\nof convincing agency\nheads that this\n\n00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.793 align:middle line:84%\nis the new way of doing\nbusiness and you've\n\n00:50:12.793 -->

align:middle line:84%\nSo FDR had to have a cabinet\nmeeting where he kind of laid\n\n00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.968 align:middle line:84%\ndown the law about\nthis is the way we're\n\n00:50:22.968 -->

line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So state\nwas a unhappy camper\n\n00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.720 align:middle line:84%\nat the very beginning, and\nFDR took it upon himself\n\n00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.520 align:middle line:90%\none evening after hours.\n\n00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.480 align:middle line:84%\nHe wrote about this, and I\nwas in hysterics reading it.\n\n00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.360 align:middle line:84%\nHe had himself taken over\nto the State Department.\n\n00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:54.020 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he describes this long\ncorridor with filing cabinets.\n\n00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.900 align:middle line:84%\nHe wheels himself up\nat random and pulls out\n\n00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:03.170 align:middle line:84%\na file on Mongolian ponies

Yeah.\n\n00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.580 align:middle line:84%\nYeah, I guess I can\nunderstand this reticence\n\n00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.070 align:middle line:84%\nwhen they're dealing

line:90%\n\n\n00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:07.960 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: I think they\nhave better access to records\n\n00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.160 align:middle line:90%\nthan they've had

line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nIt's a tough one.\n\n00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.275 align:middle line:90%\nHow prepared are we?\n\n00:53:47.275 --> 00:53:52.210 align:middle line:84%\nWe have all kinds of\nguidelines and stuff\n\n00:53:52.210 --> 00:54:00.790 align:middle line:84%\nfor natural disasters, but\nwhen it hits, it's devastating.\n\n00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:05.980 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we're so overtaxed in\nterms of space for collections\n\n00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.700 align:middle line:84%\nthat we make bargains\nwith the devil\n\n00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:14.390 align:middle

make sure\n\n00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.500 align:middle line:84%\nthat the content is\navailable in another format,\n\n00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.800 align:middle line:84%\nin case there's some kind\nof disaster like that.\n\n00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.140 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah, and\nalso, I would add too\n\n00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:41.670 align:middle line:84%\nthat there's not an equity,\nin terms of resources,\n\n00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.470 align:middle line:90%\nto different archives.\n\n00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.290 align:middle line:84%\nThe National

have an amazing\nauxiliary library facility\n\n00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.180 align:middle line:84%\nthat has state of\nthe art conditions.\n\n00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:02.490 align:middle line:84%\nBut then you've got historical\nsocieties and small archives\n\n00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:07.290 align:middle line:84%\nin places where they\ndon't have that,\n\n00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:11.790 align:middle line:84%\nand it's much more disastrous\nwhen some kind of disaster\n\n00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.290 align:middle line:90%\nhits, or a flood, or--\n\n00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.400 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And\nthey're much more frequent,\n\n00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.025 align:middle line:84%\nthose disasters are\nmuch more frequent.\n\n00:55:16.025 --> 00:55:19.720 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah and they're\nhappening much more frequently.\n\n00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.010 align:middle line:84%\nSo in a profession\nthat feels like we're\n\n00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.570 align:middle line:84%\nfrequently asked to do more\nwith less, in your career,\n\n00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:31.470 align:middle line:84%\nhow have you advocated\nfor appropriate

00:55:44.350 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Ooh that's--\nfrom the very beginning,\n\n00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:46.750 align:middle line:84%\narchives aren't the\nmost important things\n\n00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:53.140 align:middle line:84%\nin people's and funders'\nminds, administration's minds.\n\n00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.430 align:middle line:90%\nArchives aren't

00:56:08.290 align:middle line:84%\nto some initiative that\nmakes sense for the funding\n\n00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.690 align:middle line:90%\nopportunity.\n\n00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:14.770 align:middle line:84%\nPrivate foundations,\nif you can demonstrate\n\n00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.680 align:middle line:84%\nthat you have something\nthat's of value\n\n00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.200 align:middle line:84%\nto a private foundation,\nat least in my experience,\n\n00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:25.570 align:middle line:84%\nthat sends a signal\nto the administration\n\n00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:29.020 align:middle line:90%\nfunders that perhaps--\n\n00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:33.760 align:middle line:84%\nif there's a requirement\nfor a matching gift--\n\n00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.630 align:middle line:84%\nthat this is an opportunity to\nsupport something and create\n\n00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:41.623 align:middle line:84%\nsomething great that\ndistinguishes the

I\nask a related question.\n\n00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:00.110 align:middle line:84%\nSo I'm assuming that most of\nthe funding of the National\n\n00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:04.100 align:middle

people\nthink of classification\n\n00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.070 align:middle line:84%\nand classified documents as\nthat unnecessary secrecy.\n\n00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:55.740 align:middle line:84%\nSo who decides if\nit's classified\n\n00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.020 align:middle line:90%\nand how do you declassify it?\n\n00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.800 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nIt's a real issue.\n\n00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.950 align:middle line:84%\nAnother little known unit\nwithin the National Archives\n\n01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:04.290 align:middle line:84%\nis the Information\nSecurity Oversight Office,\n\n01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.270 align:middle line:84%\nwhich has responsibility\nfor overseeing\n\n01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.360 align:middle line:84%\nall the classification\nactivity, monitoring it.\n\n01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I can tell you that we\nhave a huge over classification\n\n01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:19.260 align:middle line:84%\nproblem within the government\nin the executive branch.\n\n01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:25.740 align:middle line:84%\nWe now have in the neighborhood\nof 2,500 original classifiers.\n\n01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.230 align:middle line:84%\nThese are folks who are\nauthorized to classify.\n\n01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:32.880 align:middle line:84%\nThis is down from about\n9,500 when I started in 2009.\n\n01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.610 align:middle line:84%\nSo we've narrowed\nthe number of folks\n\n01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%\nwho have the responsibility\nor have the ability.\n\n01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%\nThere are no standards\namong those 2,500 people\n\n01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%\nabout what is top\nsecret and what\n\n01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.320 align:middle line:90%\nmight not be classified at all.\n\n01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%\nUnlike other countries\nwho have carved out what\n\n01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%\nit means for each of the\nclassification areas.\n\n01:00:55.650 --> 01:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%\nIt's coupled with the fact\nthat the classification process\n\n01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.410 align:middle line:90%\nis pretty tedious.\n\n01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%\nIt's line by line,\ndetermining whether it really\n\n01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:06.600 align:middle line:90%\nneeds to be classified or not.\n\n01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.570 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it's easier just to\nclassify the whole damn document\n\n01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:13.170 align:middle line:90%\nthan to do that line by line.\n\n01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%\nAnd there was one more piece\nof it, of the declassification.\n\n01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.163 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah,\nI mean, that is also\n\n01:01:20.163 --> 01:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nRegardless of what\n\n01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%\nyou may have read\nin the press, it's\n\n01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%\nabout magic and\nwaving a magic wand.\n\n01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%\nThere is a\ndeclassification process.\n\n01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:32.600 align:middle line:84%\nOh, I know what I was going to\nsay on the classification side.\n\n01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%\nEspecially in the\nintelligence community,\n\n01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%\nthere are multiple agencies\nthat have equity in a document.\n\n01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:42.220 align:middle line:84%\nSo the classification\nmay have different levels\n\n01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%\nof classification within\nthe same document.\n\n01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%\nSo that relates to\ndeclassification also.\n\n01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%\nSo while the president does have\nthe authority to declassify,\n\n01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%\nthere is a process\nthat is followed,\n\n01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%\nso that the agencies who did\nthe original classification\n\n01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.192 align:middle line:90%\nare notified--\n\n01:01:59.192 --> 01:02:00.400 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: And can object.\n\n01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: --because\nthat's not the only

01:02:11.710 align:middle line:90%\nthey have copies also.\n\n01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%\nSo it's very important\nthat the agencies\n\n01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%\nbe notified that that\nhas been declassified.\n\n01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And if I\nunderstand this correctly,\n\n01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%\none document can also\nhave the State Department\n\n01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.270 align:middle line:90%\nhas classified--\n\n01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nMultiple equities.\n\n01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:27.890 align:middle line:90%\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI:

and all of\nthose agencies have\n\n01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:39.590 align:middle line:84%\nto declassify that particular\nportion that they originally\n\n01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:40.270 align:middle

were just so bad\n\n01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:22.763 align:middle line:90%\nthat I dropped out of school.\n\n01:03:22.763 --> 01:03:23.430 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh\n\n01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.305 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.\n\n01:03:24.305 --> 01:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%\nI Joined the Navy,\nand when I came back,\n\n01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%\nI was a liberal arts major and\nhad very different attitude\n\n01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:31.590 align:middle line:90%\ntoward higher education.\n\n01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%\nAnd took courses that\nwere meaningful to me\n\n01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%\nand a wide range across\nhistory, and literature,\n\n01:03:38.760 -->

--> 01:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%\ngave me an important basis\nfor higher education,\n\n01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:52.530 align:middle line:90%\nbut also thinking about careers.\n\n01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%\nAnd at the same time I was\nworking in my co-op position\n\n01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%\nas a junior library\nassistant in the

work.\n\n01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%\nSo it was the\ncombination of the two,\n\n01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.287 align:middle line:84%\nI think, that put\nme where I am today.\n\n01:04:11.287 --> 01:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: I like that.\n\n01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%\nSo you went from a junior\nlibrary position to

that someone,\na real professional,\n\n01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%\ncame behind me and checked\nmy work to pull the rod\n\n01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.950 align:middle

it's just\na horrible situation.\n\n01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:28.140 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I feel badly for\nespecially school librarians,\n\n01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%\nwho are the targets\nof a lot of this--\n\n01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%\nand some public\nlibrarians, also.\n\n01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.266 align:middle line:90%\nIt's hard for me to imagine.\n\n01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:39.630 align:middle line:90%\nNo, I guess it's not hard.\n\n01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:41.580 align:middle line:90%\nAnything, anything can happen.\n\n01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%\nIn terms of the\nway records might\n\n01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:50.760 align:middle line:84%\nbe influenced, the way the\nprocess works is that there\n\n01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.210 align:middle line:84%\nare records managers\nin each of the agencies\n\n01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%\nwho are responsible\nfor overseeing\n\n01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%\nall the regulations about\ncreation and maintenance\n\n01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.300 align:middle line:90%\nof records.\n\n01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%\nSo these are career\ncivil servants.\n\n01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.520 align:middle line:84%\nThey report, however,\nto their agencies.\n\n01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%\nIt's something that\nhas bothered me,\n\n01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.950 align:middle line:84%\nand in fact, I made\nrecommendations\n\n01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:20.010 align:middle line:84%\nthat all of the\nrecords folks should\n\n01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.330 align:middle line:90%\nbe reporting to the

they\n\n01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.650 align:middle line:84%\nreport to a central\nInspector General Agency.\n\n01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%\nThere has been, and I can point\nto several examples of bias\n\n01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%\nin record keeping\nin various agencies.\n\n01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%\nBecause of the\npresidential appointment\n\n01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%\nat the head of the Agency hiding\ninformation or withholding\n\n01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:58.850 align:middle line:90%\ninformation.\n\n01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%\nAnd in some cases\nchanging information.\n\n01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.410 align:middle line:84%\nSo those are things\nthat would be addressed.\n\n01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%\nI think if that\nrecords manager was\n\n01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%\nmore comfortable in\nreporting it out.\n\n01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.795 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Right, and\nhad some accountability.\n\n01:07:10.795 --> 01:07:11.795 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.\n\n01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And\nsomebody who could\n\n01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.010 align:middle line:90%\nnotice that and correct

fuzzy,\n\n01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%\nbut I know that there was an\nincident not long ago where--\n\n01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%\nI think it was\nmaybe in Ukraine--\n\n01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%\nbut somebody had posted\nsomething and then immediately\n\n01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.189 align:middle line:90%\ntaken it down.\n\n01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.859 align:middle line:84%\nBut it was still in\nthe internet archives,\n\n01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:37.300 align:middle line:84%\nand that was the only place that\nhad

line:90%\ntaken down.\n\n01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:49.065 align:middle line:84%\nSo I think this question of,\nyou have things on YouTube\n\n01:08:49.065 --> 01:08:51.729 align:middle line:84%\nand whether they have\nthat responsibility\n\n01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:53.689 align:middle line:84%\nas part of the record\nis an interesting one.\n\n01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:55.210 align:middle

worry about\naccess to records\n\n01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%\ngoes way back to\nthe very beginning.\n\n01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I got two

line:84%\nActually, my first\nquestion is unplanned\n\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%\nbecause it's\nsomething that I just\n\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%\nlearned right at the beginning\nof this event, which is--\n\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%\nDavid, would you\nlike to tell us.\n\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.780

line:84%\nAnd you asked, are these\nThomas Hart Benton?\n\n00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:90%\nAnd why did you ask that?\n\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:90%\nWhat prompted you?\n\n00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Because\nI recognized his style.\n\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%\nAnd a wonderful story about\nHarry S. Truman Presidential\n\n00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%\nLibrary, where we have\na Thomas Hart Benton.\n\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%\nAnd Benton painted it while\nHarry was still alive.\n\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we have\nwonderful photographs\n\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%\nin the Library of

line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we also have wonderful\nphotographs of Benton,\n\n00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%\nafter Harry

history.\n\n00:09:19.817 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It's underneath.\n\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:90%\nIt's underneath.\n\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:90%\nIt's still there.\n\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So my first\nquestion, essentially,\n\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%\nwas to ask you about being\nthe archivist of the United\n\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%\nStates, which later\nI'm going to follow up\n\n00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%\nto ask you to explain to the\naudience what a Presidential\n\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:90%\nLibrary is.\n\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:84%\nBut first let me ask you--\njust for our general crowd--\n\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%\ncan you explain a\nlittle bit of what\n\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.507 align:middle line:84%\ndoes it mean to be the\narchivist of the United States?\n\n00:09:49.507 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: A lot of\nthings that they didn't

00:09:55.443 align:middle line:84%\nOr in library\nschool, I'm assuming.\n\n00:09:55.443 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Forget that.\n\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah, forget that.\n\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.360 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHS]\n\n00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.235 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO:

how does one become the\nArchivist of the United States.\n\n00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Well there was\nthis ad in the New York Times.\n\n00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: I was going\nto say, I'm an archivist\n\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle

Library\n\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%\nand what looks like a very\ncushy job from this perspective.\n\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:84%\nI had a wonderful\noffice on Fifth Avenue\n\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:90%\nwith a lion outside my window.\n\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI:

--> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%\nMy assistant came in\nand said the White\n\n00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:90%\nHouse is on the phone.\n\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.672 align:middle line:90%\nSo I got on the phone.\n\n00:11:25.672 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Was it April 1?\n\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No, it wasn't.\n\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:90%\n[SUBDUED LAUGHTER]\n\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:90%\nIt was around Patriots Day.\n\n00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%\nSo it was like the\nmiddle of the month.\n\n00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:90%\nSo I got on the phone, Hello.\n\n00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%\nAnd this 12-year-old, who\nwas working on appointments\n\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:90%\nfor the president, said--\n\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.847 align:middle line:84%\nI guess I wasn't enthusiastic\nenough because he said--\n\n00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:84%\naren't you surprised to be\ngetting a call from the White\n\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:90%\nHouse?\n\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.493 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:90%\nAh.\n\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%\nSo we moved beyond\nthat, and he said\n\n00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%\nthat, I'm calling\nbecause we're looking\n\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%\nat for the position of\narchivist of the United States.\n\n00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%\nSo this is a\npresidential appointment.\n\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:84%\nAnd my sense of things\nat that point-- and even\n\n00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%\nnow-- is that presidential\nappointments are usually\n\n00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%\nsomeone who gave a lot of\nmoney to the campaign that\n\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:84%\nelected the president, or is\na friend of the president,\n\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle

why on Earth are\nyou calling me--\n\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%\n--who knows the\nbusiness and doesn't\n\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:90%\nmeet those other criteria?\n\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.287 align:middle line:90%\nSo he couldn't answer that.\n\n00:12:33.287 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Did you\nactually ask him that?\n\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.912 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No.\n\n00:12:35.912 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%\nI said, I'm very\nflattered, but you're\n\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%\nlooking at the wrong\nperson and made it clear\n\n00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%\nthat this was the end\nof the conversation.\n\n00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he said, well,\nwould you think about it\n\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:84%\nover the weekend, and\nwe'll talk again on Monday.\n\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:90%\nAnd I said, sure.\n\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.045 align:middle line:90%\nSo he called Monday morning.\n\n00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we had the\nsame conversation.\n\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:84%\nAnd 10 minutes later\nan adult called.\n\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:84%\nThe poor kid, Kyle Watkins, was\nan undergraduate at Georgetown\n\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:90%\nworking on appointments.\n\n00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: He\nwasn't in charge,\n\n00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:84%\nbut he was the one who did\nthe research that found me.\n\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh-ho.\n\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So\nhe got the honor\n\n00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%\nof calling me to tell me all\nthis, and I treated him poorly.\n\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:84%\nSo 10 minutes later\nan adult called\n\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%\nand asked if he could\ncome to New York\n\n00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:90%\nand talk to me about the job.\n\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:84%\nAnd that week Tom\nWheeler, who turned out\n\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%\nto be the director\nof the FCC later,\n\n00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%\ncame and talked about what\nthe president was looking\n\n00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:84%\nfor in the new archivist, and\nhow important the archives was\n\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.870 align:middle line:84%\ngoing to be in the\nadministration's\n\n00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:90%\nopen government initiative.\n\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the more he talked,\nthe more excited\n\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:90%\nI got about the potential.\n\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:84%\nAnd knowing that I\nknow the business,\n\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle

announced,\n\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:90%\nwho said on some listserv--\n\n00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.092 align:middle line:84%\nI can't remember which one it\nwas-- he's only a librarian.\n\n00:14:17.092 --> 00:14:17.842 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Ooh.\n\n00:14:17.842 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%\nWelcome to the IU\nlibraries, everyone.\n\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: But there\nhas been, historically,\n\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%\na lot of, I wouldn't\nsay tension,\n\n00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:84%\nbut difference among the\nlibrarians and archivists.\n\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:90%\nIt's the same business, please.\n\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%\nIt's the same business.\n\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.843 align:middle line:84%\nCollect, protect, encourage\nthe use of, fill in the blank.\n\n00:14:39.843 --> 00:14:40.635 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%\nSo you were nominated\nfor the position\n\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:90%\nby President Barack Obama.\n\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.\n\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: But you served\nunder President Obama,\n\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%\nPresident Trump, and\nthen President Biden.\n\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:90%\nSo you've kind of--\n\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.323 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It's a\nlifetime appointment.\n\n00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%\nThere is no term for the\narchivists in the United\n\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:90%\nStates.\n\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%\nSo at the end of\nan administration\n\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%\nthere are 4,000\npresidential appointments.\n\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:84%\nAnd at the end of\nan administration\n\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%\n4,000 people leave.\n\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.900 align:middle line:84%\nAnd so if you have a\npresidential appointment,\n\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%\nyou get a notice from\nthe incoming president\n\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%\nasking you to submit\nyour resignation,\n\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%\nexcept the archivist\ndoesn't get that notice.\n\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh, well,\nthat's a job perk.\n\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.127 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Right.\n\n00:15:23.127 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So one\nof the huge challenges\n\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%\nfor the National\nArchives is to ensure\n\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:84%\nthat those 4,000\npeople who are leaving\n\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%\nare leaving their\nrecords behind.\n\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Right.\n\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And\nmore challenging\n\n00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%\nis to ensure that those\n4,000 people coming in\n\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.947 align:middle line:90%\nknow what the rules are.\n\n00:15:39.947 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Right.\n\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%\nSo you kind of touched\non this a little bit,\n\n00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.385 align:middle line:90%\nbut you were nominated in--\n\n00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%\nI think it was July\nof 2009, correct?\n\n00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you were confirmed-- so\nall presidential appointments\n\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%\nhave to be vetted by the\nUnited States Senate.\n\n00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:90%\nThere are confirmation hearings.\n\n00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%\nSome of you might have\nwatched them on CNN or c-span.\n\n00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.353 align:middle line:84%\nSo everyone has to go\nthrough the whole grilling\n\n00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:90%\nprocess of having a hearing.\n\n00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Very Invasive.\n\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Right, and\nso you were actually--\n\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:84%\nI think that you were\nnominated in July of 2009\n\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:90%\nand then confirmed in November.\n\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.020 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: November\n\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So essentially\nthree months later.\n\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Right\n\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.053 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: The current\nArchivist of the United States\n\n00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:84%\nwas nominated in, I\nthink, August of 2022\n\n00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%\nand wasn't confirmed\nuntil May of 2023.\n\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%\nSo it took nine months\nto get her confirmed.\n\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:90%\nSo what is that process like?\n\n00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%\nWhat is it like to be nominated\nand go through that kind of--\n\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: As I\nsaid, it's very invasive.\n\n00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.180 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%\nSo when Tom left\nmy office, he said,\n\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.860 align:middle line:84%\nwould you come to Washington\nand talk some more?\n\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%\nAnd that's when I met\nwith the full committee\n\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%\nat the White House and\ntalked about the job.\n\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%\nAnd as I was leaving\nthe room, David Jacobson\n\n00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:90%\nwho was the head of that--\n\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%\nWho was Kyle's boss said, so can\nwe consider you our candidate.\n\n00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:90%\nAnd I said, yes.\n\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%\nAnd at that point\nit was locked down.\n\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:84%\nI couldn't talk to\nanyone except my wife\n\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%\nabout what was going on.\n\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%\nAnd that launched an\ninvestigative process.\n\n00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:84%\nFBI agents spread out\nacross the country talking\n\n00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:90%\nto anyone I ever had known.\n\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I kept getting these emails\nfrom folks, friends saying,\n\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:90%\nwhat the hell is going on?\n\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:90%\nThe FBI is at my door.\n\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh no.\n\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:84%\nThat is not what\nyou want to hear.\n\n00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.745 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nAll they can tell\n\n00:17:43.745 --> 00:17:45.742 align:middle line:84%\nme is that it's not a\ncriminal investigation.\n\n00:17:45.742 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:90%\nThanks, yeah.\n\n00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So I\npassed those tests.\n\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%\nAnd then the next\nphase is you have\n\n00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:84%\nto meet with every member\nof the Senate Committee\n\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:90%\nthat's voting on you.\n\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%\nSo a White House\nshepherd and I visited\n\n00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:90%\neach member of the committee.\n\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:84%\nAnd my favorite visit was\nwith an unnamed Senator who\n\n00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.257 align:middle line:90%\nasked me the killer question.\n\n00:18:15.257 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Which state?\n\n00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: I'm not even\ngoing to mention the state.\n\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.375 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: I'm just kidding.\n\n00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHS]\n\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.843 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: They asked\nme the killer question,\n\n00:18:20.843 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%\nso why is it that you want to\nbe the architect of the United\n\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:90%\nStates?\n\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:24.998 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:18:24.998 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.508 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you said, because I\nlike domes and columns.\n\n00:18:32.508 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No, I\npretended he said archivist\n\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%\nand I talked about his\nrecords, his papers.\n\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%\nAnd as we were leaving, the\nshepherd turned to me and said,\n\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:90%\ndid he say architect?\n\n00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.088 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Because there is\nan archivist-- or architect.\n\n00:18:47.088 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Of the Capitol.\n\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.588 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Of the Capitol.\n\n00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:90%\nRight, so.\n\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Not architect\nof the United States.\n\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: No,no,no.\n\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%\nNo architect of\nthe United States.\n\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:90%\nSo.\n\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.670 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So\nthen as a hearing.\n\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I think I'm\nthe last person who\n\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.708 align:middle line:84%\nhad a swift appointment and\nthen a vote by the full Senate.\n\n00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.292 align:middle line:90%\nYou know, because--\n\n00:19:08.292 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: But as\nyou've seen recently,\n\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%\nany member of the Senate could\nput a hold on a nomination.\n\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah\n\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And Lamar\nAlexander of Tennessee\n\n00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.245 align:middle line:90%\nput a hold on my nomination.\n\n00:19:20.245 --> 00:19:21.120 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Really?\n\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.\n\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.015 align:middle line:84%\nThe White House\ncouldn't figure out--\n\n00:19:24.015 --> 00:19:25.890 align:middle line:84%\nnobody could figure out\nwhat the problem was.\n\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%\nSo they sent me to meet with\nLamar, who was very embarrassed\n\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:90%\nthat he had put a hold on it.\n\n00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%\nBut it turns out that\none of his constituents\n\n00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:84%\nreported that the director\nof the Nixon Library\n\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.970 align:middle line:84%\nwas saying some pretty\nanti-Nixon things,\n\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%\nand he thought I\nshould know about that.\n\n00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%\nAnd once he got\nthat off the table,\n\n00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%\nthen we had a wonderful\nconversation about his--\n\n00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%\nhe used to be a president of\nthe University of Tennessee.\n\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%\nSo we talked about\nhigher education.\n\n00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:84%\nHe really embarrassed\nbecause his wife, Honey,\n\n00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%\nwas on the National\nArchives Foundation board.\n\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Ooh-ho-ho.\n\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So she\nwasn't happy about him\n\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%\nputting a hold on it.\n\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%\nSo as soon as I left the\noffice, they lifted the hold.\n\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:18.748 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I think it was the last\nunanimous vote on a nomination.\n\n00:20:18.748 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:90%\nWell, yeah.\n\n00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:84%\nBecause, like I said, the\ncurrent Archivist of the United\n\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:90%\nStates, it was very con--\n\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:90%\nNot, I think, because of her.\n\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:90%\nBut--\n\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No,\nit's the dysfunction\n\n00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%\nof

Right.\n\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:90%\nSo just to clarify for everyone.\n\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%\nSo you essentially\nare the director\n\n00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%\nand the head of the\nNational Archives, right.\n\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%\nTechnically the

wrong,\n\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%\nbut I think part\nof the reason why\n\n00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:84%\nthere is such an invasive\nprocess for vetting\n\n00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%\nthe potential Archivist\nof the United States,\n\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%\nand sending the FBI, and

line:84%\ndon't want anyone, any\npresidential appointment,\n\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%\nto be in a position\nto be blackmailed--\n\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.060

so--\n\n00:23:14.938 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the way I\nunderstand it is, that\n\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%\nwas part of a very important\ninitiative to you, which\n\n00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:26.810 align:middle line:84%\nwas to make the collections\nof the National Archives\n\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:90%\naccessible to

align:middle line:90%\nNot your problem anymore.\n\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.493 align:middle line:90%\nSo what else?\n\n00:25:08.493 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:84%\nI mean, what are some\nof

the treaties that we\nsigned with Native nations.\n\n00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%\nSo there are 375 of them which\nhave been digitized and are now\n\n00:25:35.550 -->

--> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%\nBecause they spell\nout everything\n\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%\nthat we promised to the\nIndians while we grabbed\n\n00:25:48.540 -->

collection.\n\n00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%\nBut there's another\npiece too that I would\n\n00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:90%\nput in the favorite category.\n\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%\nWhen I became the\narchivist and met\n\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.475 align:middle line:84%\nwith the directors of the\nPresidential

FERRIERO:\nThose are records,\n\n00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:90%\npresidential correspondence.\n\n00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Actually,\nso recently, I\n\n00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:84%\nreceived an email from\nsomebody you have met before.\n\n00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%\nHe's an educator who\nlives in North Carolina.\n\n00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%\nAnd his advice to me was,\nwhen you talk to David,\n\n00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:84%\nyou might ask him about\nsome of the artifacts he\n\n00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:84%\nhad in his office,\nincluding a letter\n\n00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.115 align:middle line:90%\nhe wrote to LBJ and perhaps--\n\n00:27:11.115 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Facsimiles.\n\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.698 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI:\nFacsimiles, for sure.\n\n00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:90%\nFor sure.\n\n00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:90%\nBut I thought this was a great--\n\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%\nthat these letters\nwere from you.\n\n00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you found them\nin the archives,\n\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%\nwhich struck me\nbecause, essentially,\n\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%\nwe, as citizens,\nare in the archives.\n\n00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%\nIt is not just for\nPresidential Records\n\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:90%\nand of course, it is for that.\n\n00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:84%\nBut we're all in\nit, essentially.\n\n00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.492 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: One of the\nactivities for the sleepover\n\n00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:84%\nis kids get an\nopportunity to write\n\n00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:90%\na letter to the president.\n\n00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.380 align:middle line:90%\nAnd we deliver them.\n\n00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.588 align:middle line:84%\nOn Monday morning we deliver\nthem to the White House,\n\n00:27:45.588 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:90%\nand President Obama responded.\n\n00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Awe.\n\n00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%\nThat reminds me\nactually of, in 2018,\n\n00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%\nwhen I had an\nopportunity to visit\n\n00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:84%\nRichard Lugar at\nhis office, and I\n\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:90%\nhad my picture taken with him.\n\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:84%\nAnd in the mail I\ngot a signed copy.\n\n00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I said, do I\nhave to archive this?\n\n00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.305 align:middle line:90%\nLike, I have this picture.\n\n00:28:09.305 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: [LAUGHS]\n\n00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: But\nI've also read things,\n\n00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%\nwhere for instance, the\nNational Archives has veterans\n\n00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:90%\nrecords and military records.\n\n00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you, yourself,\nare a veteran, right.\n\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%\nAnd there were several blog\nposts about the 1950 census\n\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:84%\nwhich was recently\nreleased, and people\n\n00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.320 align:middle line:84%\nwho found their relatives\nonline, or found\n\n00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:90%\ntheir parents in the census.\n\n00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%\nSo essentially, again, we're\nall in the National Archives.\n\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.\n\n00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%\nSo when I visited Saint Louis,\nwhere our military records are,\n\n00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.820 align:middle line:84%\nthere's a special vault\nfor high-end veterans.\n\n00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%\nRecords that we want make\nsure we want to make sure\n\n00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:59.520 align:middle line:90%\naren't tampered or messed up.\n\n00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:84%\nNot that there's a\nlot of that goes on.\n\n00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:90%\nBut the VIP vaults.\n\n00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:84%\nSo they took me on a\ntour of the VIP vault\n\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.222 align:middle line:84%\nand handed me Elvis's\nservice record.\n\n00:29:09.222 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:90%\nAnd was it?\n\n00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.502 align:middle line:84%\nOh Yeah, so I think\nthat recently--\n\n00:29:17.502 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:84%\nand I want to see if\nthis is still true--\n\n00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%\nbut recently we watched a\nprogram from the New York\n\n00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%\nHistorical Society\nthat was an interview\n\n00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%\nwith the current Archivist\nof the United States, Colleen\n\n00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:27.570 align:middle line:90%\nShogan.\n\n00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:84%\nAnd she was asked\nthe question of what\n\n00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%\nis the most requested\nand popular item.\n\n00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%\nAnd she said it was\nthe photograph of Elvis\n\n00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.667 align:middle line:90%\nwith President Richard Nixon.\n\n00:29:36.667 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yes.\n\n00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Is that?\n\n00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nIt's a great story.\n\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah?\n\n00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: You\nwant to hear it?\n\n00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Absolutely.\n\n00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: OK.\n\n00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.922 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Do\nyou want to hear it?\n\n00:29:42.922 --> 00:29:44.220 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So\nElvis collected badges.\n\n00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he had badges from\nall over the country.\n\n00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the one that he really\nwanted was an FBI badge,\n\n00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%\nand the FBI refused\nto give him a badge.\n\n00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%\nSo he took it upon himself\nto fly from Los Angeles--\n\n00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:90%\nhe was on the West Coast.\n\n00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.710 align:middle line:84%\nHe flew to Washington\non American Airlines\n\n00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.700 align:middle line:84%\nbecause he asked the flight\nattendant for stationery\n\n00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%\nto write a letter\nto President Nixon,\n\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%\nasking to meet with him\nbecause he wanted to volunteer\n\n00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.440 align:middle line:90%\nfor his war on drugs.\n\n00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.030 align:middle line:90%\nNothing about badges.\n\n00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.350 align:middle line:90%\nNothing about badges.\n\n00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.250 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And he and he\ngot into a cab at the airport\n\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%\nand got delivered\nto the West Wing\n\n00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.005 align:middle line:84%\ngate, where he handed the\nletter in, which you can't do.\n\n00:30:43.005 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:90%\nThey won't accept anything.\n\n00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%\nSo don't try and leave a letter\nat the gate at the White House.\n\n00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.910 align:middle line:90%\nAnd it ended up in Bud Krogh--\n\n00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.220 align:middle line:84%\nBud Krogh, who\nwas chief of Staff\n\n00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:84%\nto President Nixon\nand a huge Elvis fan.\n\n00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:90%\nIt ended up in his hands.\n\n00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:84%\nAnd sure enough, Elvis was\ninvited, that afternoon,\n\n00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.570 align:middle line:84%\nto come and to visit\nwith the president.\n\n00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:90%\nBud did a program with us.\n\n00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:84%\nAnd if you google Bud Krogh\nElvis National Archives,\n\n00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:84%\nyou can watch this\nwonderful conversation\n\n00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.840 align:middle line:84%\nwith Bud telling\nthe story of Nixon\n\n00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.550 align:middle line:84%\nnot really knowing\nwho Elvis was.\n\n00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:84%\nAnd do I really have\nto meet with him?\n\n00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:90%\nAnd all of this.\n\n00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:84%\nThere wasn't any conversation\nabout drugs or anything\n\n00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%\nin this one on one\nwith the president,\n\n00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:84%\nbut he got to the point\nwhere he wanted a badge.\n\n00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.830 align:middle line:84%\nHe really wanted an FBI badge,\nso he asked Nixon for it.\n\n00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%\nAnd Nixon turned to Bud\nand said, can I do that?\n\n00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:84%\nAnd Bud Krogh says,\nof course you can.\n\n00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:90%\nYou're the president.\n\n00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.725 align:middle line:90%\nSo guess what?\n\n00:31:50.725 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Did he\nget the FBI badge?\n\n00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: He\ngot the FBI badge.\n\n00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.340 align:middle line:84%\nAnd then Bud tells\nthe story of--\n\n00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:90%\nthis is true of every president.\n\n00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:84%\nThe resolute desk\nhas a bottom drawer\n\n00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%\nfull of gifts that the\npresident gives to visitors\n\n00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.160 align:middle line:84%\nand they're arranged\nin priority order,\n\n00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.320 align:middle line:84%\nfor the cheap stuff at the front\nand the really expensive stuff\n\n00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:90%\nat the back.\n\n00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:84%\nSo Nixon said to Elvis, I\nwant to give you a gift.\n\n00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.850 align:middle line:84%\nSo Elvis got up out of\nhis chair and went around\n\n00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%\nthe back of the desk instead\nof waiting for the president.\n\n00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:90%\nAnd he goes and pulls up--\n\n00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:84%\nI forget what he pulled\nout-- but went right\n\n00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:84%\nto the back of the\ndrawer and pulled out\n\n00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.362 align:middle line:90%\nthe most expensive stuff.\n\n00:32:30.362 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: The good stuff.\n\n00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.270 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHS]\n\n00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So we have the\nletter in the Nixon Library.\n\n00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%\nWe have the letter that Elvis\nwrote and wonderful pictures.\n\n00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.850 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the picture is on shower\ncurtains, coffee mugs.\n\n00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:90%\nIt's on T-shirts, sweatshirts.\n\n00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:90%\nIt's on everything.\n\n00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.600 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And so\nalong those lines,\n\n00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%\nwhere do Presidential records\nand Presidential papers\n\n00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.430 align:middle line:90%\nfit in to all of this?\n\n00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:08.260 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: As of 1978,\nbecause President Nixon\n\n00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:84%\nconsidered his papers\nprivate, not public--\n\n00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:90%\nand the whole Watergate thing--\n\n00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.610 align:middle line:84%\nCongress decided we need\nto codify this and make\n\n00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%\nit clear that Presidential\nrecords are public records.\n\n00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.430 align:middle line:84%\nSo they belong to the\nfederal government.\n\n00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the way it\nworks is the records\n\n00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:84%\nare maintained in\nthe White House\n\n00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:90%\nduring the administration.\n\n00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.650 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it isn't until\nthe inauguration\n\n00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:84%\nof the new president,\nduring that ceremony,\n\n00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%\nthat the records are transferred\nto the National Archives.\n\n00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.718 align:middle line:84%\nThey stay in the White\nHouse until then.\n\n00:33:48.718 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So you kind of\ntouched on it a little bit\n\n00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.640 align:middle line:84%\nabout the personal ownership\nversus the public ownership,\n\n00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:90%\nbecause for centuries--\n\n00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%\nI mean 1 and 1/2\ncenturies, 150 years--\n\n00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.822 align:middle line:84%\nPresidential papers were\nconsidered personal property.\n\n00:34:03.822 --> 00:34:06.280 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And they're\nscattered all over the country.\n\n00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:06.760 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Library of\nCongress has a lot of them.\n\n00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%\nBut it wasn't until\nFDR, actually,\n\n00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:84%\nwho had the first\nPresidential Library.\n\n00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:84%\nI'm convinced that FDR\nwas a closet archivist,\n\n00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.469 align:middle line:90%\nbecause he really paid--\n\n00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.060 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: There are a lot\nof them out there, actually.\n\n00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.143 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: I know it.\n\n00:34:23.143 --> 00:34:25.330 align:middle line:84%\nHe really paid attention\nto organization.\n\n00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he actually-- you probably\ndon't know this-- but,\n\n00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:84%\nyou archivists, he created\nthe prototype phase box\n\n00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:35.675 align:middle line:84%\nthat you now store\nyour records in.\n\n00:34:35.675 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Really?\n\n00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It\nwasn't with acid free--\n\n00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.580 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: The archivists\nare really excited about this.\n\n00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.097 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It wasn't with\nacid free paper or anything,\n\n00:34:43.097 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:90%\nbut it's the same box.\n\n00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.460 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: I read\nan interesting thing.\n\n00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.610 align:middle line:84%\nSo I want to touch on this issue\nof the Presidential Libraries,\n\n00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.300 align:middle line:84%\nbecause you mentioned\nit with Truman.\n\n00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.842 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you've talked\nabout a little bit.\n\n00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:55.130 align:middle line:84%\nBut a little tidbit that\nI found out about FDR,\n\n00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.800 align:middle line:84%\nso Franklin Roosevelt\nwas the first president\n\n00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%\nto start a Presidential\nLibrary, right.\n\n00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.240 align:middle line:84%\nSo it's to look at\neverything and say, Wow, I've\n\n00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:90%\ngot a lot of cool stuff.\n\n00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:84%\nI should make it accessible\nto the American people.\n\n00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%\nAnd so he established\na library and a museum.\n\n00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he had tons of gifts,\nand memorabilia, and chairs,\n\n00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.390 align:middle line:90%\nand I don't know what.\n\n00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.420 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the archivist who was\nworking with him said, do you\n\n00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.943 align:middle line:90%\nreally need all of this?\n\n00:35:18.943 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:84%\nDo you really want to put\nall of this in the museum?\n\n00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he said, if people\nare going to pay a quarter\n\n00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.950 align:middle line:84%\nto come to this library,\nthey need to see some stuff.\n\n00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:90%\nThey're paying a quarter.\n\n00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:84%\nBut could you talk a little\nbit about what a Presidential\n\n00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.010 align:middle line:84%\nLibrary is versus the\nPresidential Records\n\n00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.527 align:middle line:84%\nthat go into the\nNational Archives\n\n00:35:38.527 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:90%\nand what that system looks like.\n\n00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nIt's a combination.\n\n00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:90%\nIt's artifacts and records.\n\n00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:84%\nSo state gifts and lots of\ngifts from the American public\n\n00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:84%\nall become part of-- those\nare considered records--\n\n00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.210 align:middle line:84%\nand become part of the museum\naspect of the Presidential\n\n00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.230 align:middle line:90%\nLibrary.\n\n00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:90%\nWe have a wonderful--\n\n00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%\nthe largest collection of\nmacaroni paintings in the world\n\n00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%\nare in our\nPresidential Libraries.\n\n00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%\nWe have every shoe that\nHillary Clinton ever wore.\n\n00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.350 align:middle line:84%\nWe have a lot of First\nLady [LAUGHS] wardrobes.\n\n00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:22.295 align:middle line:84%\nAnd Hillary Clinton is still\ndelivering shoes to the Clinton\n\n00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:23.170 align:middle line:90%\nPresidential Library.\n\n00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:90%\nVery strange collections.\n\n00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: But the\npublic can visit them.\n\n00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yes.\n\n00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.930 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And\nthey have exhibitions.\n\n00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:32.930 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.\n\n00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And you\ncan see the shoes.\n\n00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:90%\nCan you try them on though?\n\n00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No.\n\n00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.638 align:middle line:84%\nAfter I had done my\nfirst tour of all\n\n00:36:39.638 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:84%\nthe Presidential Libraries\nand seen all of these,\n\n00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:84%\nI started putting\nthings together\n\n00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.900 align:middle line:84%\nand threatened to do a first\nlady shoe exhibit from--\n\n00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.150 align:middle line:84%\nDIANE DALLIS-COMENTALE: I\nthink the Met did an exhibit\n\n00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%\non first lady dresses.\n\n00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.570 align:middle line:84%\nSo I don't know why\nyou wouldn't do shoes.\n\n00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: We\ncould do that too.\n\n00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:54.850 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah.\n\n00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yeah,\nwe could do that too.\n\n00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.790 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So one of the\nthings that you also mentioned,\n\n00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%\nthat is in the\nevent description,\n\n00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:84%\nthat I do want to talk about is\nthe theme for IU's Themester.\n\n00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:84%\nThis last Themester is\nLux et Veritas, right,\n\n00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:84%\nwhich translates\ninto light and truth.\n\n00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%\nIt's also actually part of\nthe motto on the official seal\n\n00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.810 align:middle line:90%\nof Indiana University.\n\n00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.660 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I know that when\nmy colleagues first\n\n00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:84%\nhad this idea of celebrating\nthis last Themester\n\n00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.610 align:middle line:84%\nand inviting you, they had this\nreally nice idea of shining\n\n00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:84%\nthe light of truth onto records,\nand history, and archives,\n\n00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:90%\nand things along those lines.\n\n00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.440 align:middle line:84%\nAnd you've talked\nabout open government\n\n00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.820 align:middle line:90%\nand the open government system.\n\n00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%\nCan you talk a little\nbit of what that means.\n\n00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.210 align:middle line:84%\nWhat does open government\nmean, and why is it important?\n\n00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.460 align:middle line:84%\nWhy is it an\nimportant principle?\n\n00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.370 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So in the Obama\nlanguage for open government,\n\n00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:01.880 align:middle line:84%\nit was transparency,\nparticipation,\n\n00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:90%\nand collaboration.\n\n00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:84%\nThose are the three linchpins\nof what open government means.\n\n00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.190 align:middle line:84%\nAnd for the National\nArchives, we\n\n00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.440 align:middle line:84%\ntried hard to figure\nout ways that we\n\n00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.580 align:middle line:90%\ncould fulfill that vision.\n\n00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.030 align:middle line:84%\nSo on his first day in\noffice, the president\n\n00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%\nmet with his senior staff\nand made the statement\n\n00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:84%\nthat the government doesn't\nhave all the answers,\n\n00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.110 align:middle line:84%\nand we need to figure out ways\nto engage the American public\n\n00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:90%\nin doing our work.\n\n00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:32.150 align:middle line:84%\nSo we took that very seriously\nat the National Archives\n\n00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.100 align:middle line:84%\nand worked on and\nthought about ways\n\n00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:84%\nthat we could engage\nthe public in the work\n\n00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.030 align:middle line:84%\nthat we do, which resulted in\nthe creation of the Citizen\n\n00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:84%\nArchivist project, where we have\nopportunities for the public\n\n00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:84%\nto help us, in a number of ways,\nin making access to our records\n\n00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:90%\nbetter.\n\n00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:84%\nSo, as you probably\nknow, cursive\n\n00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.030 align:middle line:84%\nisn't taught much\nin schools anymore.\n\n00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:84%\nAnd about 80% of the Federal\nRecords are in cursive.\n\n00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.800 align:middle line:84%\nSo we have kids now,\nand their parents\n\n00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.620 align:middle line:84%\nin lots of cases, who\ncan't read these records.\n\n00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.510 align:middle line:84%\nAnd in fact, I was\ntalking to a couple\n\n00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%\nof adults last night who\ncouldn't read records,\n\n00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.287 align:middle line:90%\ncouldn't read cursive.\n\n00:39:13.287 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Or even\nfrom the 19th century,\n\n00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.030 align:middle line:84%\neven if you can read cursive,\nit's a different kind\n\n00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:90%\nand it's--\n\n00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Don't\ngive me any excuses.\n\n00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.747 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: OK, all right.\n\n00:39:21.747 --> 00:39:22.482 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:23.190 align:middle line:90%\nI take that back.\n\n00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.990 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: So we\nhave loaded thousands\n\n00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.510 align:middle line:84%\nof records in the Citizen\nArchivist Dashboard\n\n00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.700 align:middle line:84%\nand you can go in and\ntranscribe for us.\n\n00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.620 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we've got folks\nfrom, actually,\n\n00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.750 align:middle line:84%\naround the world who are\nparticipating in this.\n\n00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.790 align:middle line:84%\nAnd to date, we have I think\nthe figure is something\n\n00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:44.655 align:middle line:84%\nlike 250 million transcriptions\nhave been done of our records.\n\n00:39:44.655 --> 00:39:47.280 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And this is just,\nwhen you say Citizen Archivist,\n\n00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.260 align:middle line:84%\nthis is just people,\njust the public.\n\n00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.350 align:middle line:84%\nWell, I mean, these are not\nnecessarily employees of NARA.\n\n00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.142 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: There's\na wonderful nursing\n\n00:39:57.142 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%\nhome in Massachusetts that\nhas adopted this project.\n\n00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.472 align:middle line:84%\nAnd they do they\ndo transcriptions.\n\n00:40:01.472 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So this\nis for anyone who's\n\n00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.130 align:middle line:90%\ninterested in getting involved.\n\n00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.270 align:middle line:90%\nIs it still going?\n\n00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.470 align:middle line:90%\nCan people still get in--\n\n00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.920 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Oh Yeah\n\n00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: How they get\ninvolved in the project?\n\n00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.557 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Archives.gov\n\n00:40:10.557 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Archives.gov OK.\n\n00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:84%\nDo you do crowdsourcing\nlike, with photographs?\n\n00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Oh\nyeah, we do that.\n\n00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.300 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.587 align:middle line:84%\nThere are several\ndifferent options.\n\n00:40:19.587 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:90%\nYou can do transcriptions.\n\n00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:90%\nYou can tag photos.\n\n00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%\nAs I said, we have 43\nmillion photographs\n\n00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:90%\nand not very well described.\n\n00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.180 align:middle line:84%\nSo we've loaded\nthousands of photographs\n\n00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:84%\nwhere people are tagging people\nthat they recognize, or places\n\n00:40:34.410 -->

00:40:43.200 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So what\nis the result of this.\n\n00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:84%\nHow many people have been\ninvolved as Citizen Archivists.\n\n00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:50.145 align:middle line:84%\nAnd has NARA been\npleased with the results?\n\n00:40:50.145 --> 00:40:51.770 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: The\nresults have been--\n\n00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.103 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: How's the quality?\n\n00:40:53.103 --> 00:40:55.320 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: I can't\ngive you numbers of people.\n\n00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:84%\nBut we've been very\npleased with the quality\n\n00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.800 align:middle line:84%\nof the transcriptions\nand each one\n\n00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.680 align:middle line:84%\nis checked to make sure\nthat it's accurate.\n\n00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:84%\nAnother way that we've focused\non-- this came up in my meeting\n\n00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:90%\nwith the students today.\n\n00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.220 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:84%\nEvery attempt is to make our\ncontent accessible in any way\n\n00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.500 align:middle line:90%\nwe possibly can.\n\n00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:25.040 align:middle line:84%\nSo we've devoted a lot of work,\ntime, and effort on Wikipedia.\n\n00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.790 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah\n\n00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.415 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Hired the first\nfederal Wikipedian in residence\n\n00:41:28.415 --> 00:41:31.400 align:middle line:84%\nwas part of the\nNational Archives staff,\n\n00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:84%\nwho had the dual role of\nhelping us create those links\n\n00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:84%\nbut also educating the staff\nabout the power of Wikipedia.\n\n00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:48.380 align:middle line:84%\nSo now our processing\nfolks link record groups\n\n00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.400 align:middle line:90%\nto articles in Wikipedia.\n\n00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.030 align:middle line:84%\nAnd there are probably\nin the neighborhood\n\n00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:01.010 align:middle line:84%\nof 4,000 to 5,000\nWikipedia records that\n\n00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:84%\nhave content that have links\nfrom the National Archives.\n\n00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:13.160 align:middle

00:42:19.970 align:middle line:84%\ninitiated a huge social\nmedia initiative as well.\n\n00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.\n\n00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.980 align:middle line:84%\nWhen I was coming to\nWashington for one\n\n00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.100 align:middle line:84%\nof those meetings on the Hill\nwith the Senate Committee.\n\n00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.550 align:middle line:84%\nI'm not even the archivist yet,\nbut I'm reading the New York\n\n00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%\nTimes and there's this article\nabout the

align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: And I'm saying\nto myself, oh wait a minute.\n\n00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:90%\nWhere's the National Archives?\n\n00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.680 align:middle line:90%\nWhy aren't they all over this?\n\n00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it turns out that the\nNational Archives wasn't doing\n\n00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.860 align:middle line:90%\nanything with social media.\n\n00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:90%\nAnd this is 2009.\n\n00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.180 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I discovered that there\nwas a small group of folks\n\n00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.690 align:middle line:84%\nwho were interested\nin social media\n\n00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:09.690 align:middle line:84%\nand were meeting in secret\nto talk about their dreams\n\n00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.750 align:middle line:84%\nabout how they might\nuse social media.\n\n00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.855 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I heard about\nthis, and I walked\n\n00:43:15.855 --> 00:43:16.980 align:middle line:90%\ninto one of their meetings.\n\n00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:84%\nAnd they thought\nthey were busted.\n\n00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.580 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.560 align:middle line:84%\nAnd we sat down and had\na great conversation.\n\n00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:84%\nAnd at that meeting I\nauthorized the purchase\n\n00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:84%\nof iPads and iPhones,\n25 to fool around.\n\n00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:90%\nAnd let's get started here.\n\n00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:45.210 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the next morning I got a\ncall from my CIO, who said,\n\n00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:84%\nI understand you want\niPads and iPhones.\n\n00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.030 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I said, Yeah,\nisn't it exciting.\n\n00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:middle line:84%\nWe're going to experiment\nand blah, blah, blah.\n\n00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.790 align:middle line:84%\nAnd she said, well, you know, we\ndon't support that technology.\n\n00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh.\n\n00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.007 align:middle line:90%\nIPads and iPhones?\n\n00:43:57.007 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Then\nI said, you know,\n\n00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.150 align:middle line:84%\nthe best part about\nthis technology\n\n00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:01.483 align:middle line:90%\nis it doesn't need your support.\n\n00:44:01.483 --> 00:44:04.770 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:09.330

00:44:12.467 align:middle line:90%\nI say, isn't it exciting.\n\n00:44:12.467 --> 00:44:13.800 align:middle line:90%\nWe're going to be experimenting.\n\n00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.367 align:middle

--> 00:44:18.365 align:middle line:90%\nYeah.\n\n00:44:18.365 --> 00:44:19.990 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nThat'll take 13 months.\n\n00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.750 align:middle line:90%\n13 months.\n\n00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.520 align:middle line:84%\nI said, no, that's\nnot good enough.\n\n00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:90%\nUh-Uh, that doesn't work for me.\n\n00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.370 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: I\nactually had a student--\n\n00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.110 align:middle line:90%\nI hope she's here today, but--\n\n00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:84%\ncontact me yesterday\nfrom the IDS\n\n00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:84%\nwith the Indiana Daily Student,\nwhich is a student newspaper.\n\n00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.970 align:middle line:84%\nAnd she asked me a really\ninteresting question.\n\n00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:84%\nShe asked me what I found\nmost interesting or inspiring\n\n00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.190 align:middle line:90%\nabout you.\n\n00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:48.760 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I have to say that\nmy answer was actually\n\n00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.670 align:middle line:84%\nthe \"Gighy\" or\n\"Jiphy,\" depending\n\n00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:84%\non how you pronounce it, the\nGiphy Channel for the National\n\n00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:55.480 align:middle line:90%\nArchives.\n\n00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.440 align:middle line:90%\nBecause I checked it out.\n\n00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:90%\nIt's amazing.\n\n00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.350 align:middle line:84%\nThere are 1,500 JIFs\nor GIFs, depending\n\n00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:84%\non your preference,\nthat have been uploaded\n\n00:45:07.390 -->

amazing because there\nare things from World War One,\n\n00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.530 align:middle line:84%\nWorld War Two, but\nalso space exploration,\n\n00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.940 align:middle

line:84%\nBut also kids\nsledding, and holidays,\n\n00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:35.783 align:middle line:84%\nand my favorite, which is\nthe dancing dogs, Waffles\n\n00:45:35.783 --> 00:45:36.325

tutus.\n\n00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:43.240 align:middle line:84%\nAnd what I said\nwas that, to me it\n\n00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.350 align:middle line:84%\nis making the federal government\nand the National Archives\n\n00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:90%\nmore accessible.\n\n00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.290 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it is saying to\npeople, everyone's welcome.\n\n00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:58.450 align:middle line:84%\nWe're not just this imposing\nbuilding on Pennsylvania Avenue\n\n00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:59.800 align:middle line:90%\nbut we're you.\n\n00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.240 align:middle line:90%\nWe're About you.\n\n00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.970 align:middle line:84%\nSo is this kind of\nsomething that you felt--\n\n00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:84%\nhow do you feel that this\nhelped with NARA's image?\n\n00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.840 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: First of\nall, it was unleashing\n\n00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.630 align:middle line:84%\nthe talent within the\nAgency that these folks have\n\n00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.570 align:middle line:84%\nbeen dreaming about things\nto do with social media.\n\n00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:21.550 align:middle line:84%\nAs I said, in 2009 we were not\non any social media platforms.\n\n00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.440 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the argument I\nmade with the staff\n\n00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.380 align:middle line:84%\nwas, we are responsible\nfor providing\n\n00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:84%\nguidance to the agencies\nabout the records\n\n00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.130 align:middle line:84%\nimplications of their\nuse of social media.\n\n00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.430 align:middle line:84%\nAnd if we're not using\nthis stuff ourselves,\n\n00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:84%\nhow are we possibly\ngoing to do that?\n\n00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:84%\nSo we're now on 16 platforms\nand the staff is energized,\n\n00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:51.370 align:middle line:84%\nand it has spread\nto State Archives\n\n00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:55.792 align:middle line:84%\nand other archives have been\nfollowing what we're doing.\n\n00:46:55.792 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Well,\nand I noticed--\n\n00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.870 align:middle line:84%\nand we'll start\nwith the questions--\n\n00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:04.840 align:middle line:84%\nbut I also noticed that the\nTrump Presidential Library\n\n00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.638 align:middle line:90%\nhas an archive of his tweets.\n\n00:47:06.638 --> 00:47:07.930 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yes, of course.\n\n00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.860 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So social\nmedia is actually\n\n00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.010 align:middle line:84%\nan important social\nphenomenon that\n\n00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:84%\nis woven into the nation's\nhistory and the Presidential\n\n00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.350 align:middle line:90%\nRecords.\n\n00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.760 align:middle line:84%\nAll right, so now we will\nturn to y'all's questions.\n\n00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%\nSo the first one for you\nis, while we narrowly\n\n00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:84%\navoided a government shutdown,\nyou saw the National Archives\n\n00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.590 align:middle line:90%\nthrough a few shutdowns.\n\n00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:38.920 align:middle line:84%\nHow did these impact the work\nof NARA, short and long term?\n\n00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.590 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It's\na horrible situation\n\n00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:45.970 align:middle line:84%\nbecause we have no idea how long\nthe shutdown is going to last.\n\n00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:90%\nThat the staff by and large--\n\n00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.360 align:middle line:84%\nwe have, for the National\nArchives it's 3,000 people\n\n00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:57.370 align:middle line:90%\nin 42 facilities in 17 states--\n\n00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.830 align:middle line:84%\nmost of them live\npaycheck to paycheck.\n\n00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.650 align:middle line:84%\nThey're not getting paid,\nand they have no idea\n\n00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:90%\nhow long this is going to last.\n\n00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.920 align:middle line:84%\nFor the longer ones, and we've\nbeen through some longer ones,\n\n00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.060 align:middle line:84%\npeople have actually left\nand taken other jobs.\n\n00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:18.430 align:middle line:84%\nBut the damage it\ndoes to people feeling\n\n00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.940 align:middle line:84%\ngood about working for the\ngovernment and the damage\n\n00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.262 align:middle line:84%\nit does in recruiting\nis really serious.\n\n00:48:25.262 --> 00:48:27.220 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: We talked\nabout this this morning\n\n00:48:27.220 -->

closet archivist.\n\n00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:27.370 align:middle line:84%\nBut he really took an\ninterest in the archives,\n\n00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.460 align:middle line:84%\nrecruited the

00:49:59.560 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nThere was a point\n\n00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:84%\nI was trying to make with\n[LAUGHS] why we had to go

00:50:10.990 align:middle line:84%\nof convincing agency\nheads that this\n\n00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.793 align:middle line:84%\nis the new way of doing\nbusiness and you've\n\n00:50:12.793 -->

align:middle line:84%\nSo FDR had to have a cabinet\nmeeting where he kind of laid\n\n00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.968 align:middle line:84%\ndown the law about\nthis is the way we're\n\n00:50:22.968 -->

align:middle line:90%\none evening after hours.\n\n00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.480 align:middle line:84%\nHe wrote about this, and I\nwas in hysterics reading it.\n\n00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.360 align:middle line:84%\nHe had himself taken over\nto the State Department.\n\n00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:54.020 align:middle line:84%\nAnd he describes this long\ncorridor with filing

Yeah.\n\n00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.580 align:middle line:84%\nYeah, I guess I can\nunderstand this reticence\n\n00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.070 align:middle line:84%\nwhen they're dealing

we're so overtaxed in\nterms of space for collections\n\n00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.700 align:middle line:84%\nthat we make bargains\nwith the devil\n\n00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:14.390 align:middle

align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah and they're\nhappening much more frequently.\n\n00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.010 align:middle line:84%\nSo in a profession\nthat feels like we're\n\n00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.570 align:middle line:84%\nfrequently asked to do more\nwith less, in your career,\n\n00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:31.470 align:middle line:84%\nhow have you advocated\nfor appropriate

00:55:44.350 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Ooh that's--\nfrom the very beginning,\n\n00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:46.750 align:middle line:84%\narchives aren't the\nmost important

line:84%\nArchives comes from\nCongress from appropriations\n\n00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.480 align:middle line:90%\nbills and et cetera.\n\n00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.958 align:middle line:84%\nDoes it cover all of the funding\nfor the National Archives?\n\n00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:10.250 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: No, we have\na private foundation, also,\n\n00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:11.210 align:middle line:90%\nthat raises money.\n\n00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:14.240 align:middle line:84%\nAnd all the education\nprograms, exhibits,\n\n00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.900 align:middle line:84%\nare funded by the\nprivate foundation.\n\n00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.990 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the Presidential Libraries\nhave private foundations also.\n\n00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:25.460 align:middle line:84%\nAnd they fund, depending\nupon the library,\n\n00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.380 align:middle line:90%\nvarious aspects of the work.\n\n00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:28.250 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: OK.\n\n00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:31.460 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nBut the government\n\n00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:35.000 align:middle line:84%\nwork of maintaining\nthe records, that's\n\n00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.500 align:middle line:90%\npaid for by the government.\n\n00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.090 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: OK.\n\n00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.260 align:middle line:84%\nWhat is the process\nfor requesting access\n\n00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.418 align:middle line:90%\nto restricted materials?\n\n00:57:44.418 --> 00:57:46.960 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: It depends on\nwhat the restricted material is\n\n00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:51.460 align:middle line:84%\nand what the requirements\nare for access.\n\n00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.850 align:middle line:90%\nYou can file a FOIA request.\n\n00:57:54.850 --> 00:58:02.320 align:middle line:84%\nAnd one of the ways to expedite\nthat FOIA request, if you're\n\n00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.360 align:middle line:84%\nhaving trouble with\nyour FOIA request,\n\n00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.530 align:middle line:84%\nthere is a little\nknown organization\n\n00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:11.290 align:middle line:84%\nunit within the\nNational Archives\n\n00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:13.863 align:middle line:84%\ncalled the Office of Government\nInformation Services--\n\n00:58:13.863 --> 00:58:15.530 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: I have\nto write that down.\n\n00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.800 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: --which\nis the FOIA

question--\n\n00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:44.210 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: All of the FOIA\nfolks in all of the agencies,\n\n00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:46.340 align:middle line:84%\nand I can tell you this\nfrom personal experience,\n\n00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.810 align:middle line:90%\nare overworked.\n\n00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:50.580 align:middle line:84%\nThere aren't enough people\nhandling FOIA requests.\n\n00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.280 align:middle line:90%\nIt's a huge problem\n\n00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:57.380 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah, I recently\nattended an online forum\n\n00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.440 align:middle line:84%\non the mandatory\ndeclassification review\n\n00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:05.840 align:middle line:84%\nprocess, and they said something\nlike, the vast majority of FOIA\n\n00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:11.450 align:middle line:84%\nrequests come from only a\nvery small number of agencies\n\n00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:12.590 align:middle line:90%\nor people, essentially.\n\n00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:15.980 align:middle line:84%\nAnd that they make so many\nrequests that it clogs up\n\n00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.680 align:middle line:90%\nthe system a lot.\n\n00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.300 align:middle line:84%\nAnd then a related\nquestion to that\n\n00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.900 align:middle line:84%\ntoo and along the lines\nof what I just asked,\n\n00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:27.772 align:middle line:84%\nis restricted materials but\nalso classified materials--\n\n00:59:27.772 --> 00:59:28.730 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: [GASPS]\n\n00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:30.320 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:35.160 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Because you\nsaid, with sunshine week,\n\n00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.410 align:middle line:84%\nthe open government\ncelebration, you\n\n00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:41.850 align:middle line:84%\nmentioned that the whole\npoint of the open government\n\n00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:45.480 align:middle line:84%\nis transparency and avoiding\nunnecessary secrecy.\n\n00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:49.680 align:middle line:84%\nBut I think several people\nthink of classification\n\n00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.070 align:middle line:84%\nand classified documents as\nthat unnecessary secrecy.\n\n00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:55.740 align:middle line:84%\nSo who decides if\nit's classified\n\n00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.020 align:middle line:90%\nand how do you declassify it?\n\n00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.800 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nIt's a real issue.\n\n00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.950 align:middle line:84%\nAnother little known unit\nwithin the National Archives\n\n01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:04.290 align:middle line:84%\nis the Information\nSecurity Oversight Office,\n\n01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.270 align:middle line:84%\nwhich has responsibility\nfor overseeing\n\n01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.360 align:middle line:84%\nall the classification\nactivity, monitoring it.\n\n01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I can tell you that we\nhave a huge over classification\n\n01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:19.260 align:middle line:84%\nproblem within the government\nin the executive branch.\n\n01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:25.740 align:middle line:84%\nWe now have in the neighborhood\nof 2,500 original classifiers.\n\n01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.230 align:middle line:84%\nThese are folks who are\nauthorized to classify.\n\n01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:32.880 align:middle line:84%\nThis is down from about\n9,500 when I started in 2009.\n\n01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.610 align:middle line:84%\nSo we've narrowed\nthe number of folks\n\n01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%\nwho have the responsibility\nor have the ability.\n\n01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%\nThere are no standards\namong those 2,500 people\n\n01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%\nabout what is top\nsecret and what\n\n01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.320 align:middle line:90%\nmight not be classified at all.\n\n01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%\nUnlike other countries\nwho have carved out what\n\n01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%\nit means for each of the\nclassification areas.\n\n01:00:55.650 --> 01:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%\nIt's coupled with the fact\nthat the classification process\n\n01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.410 align:middle line:90%\nis pretty tedious.\n\n01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%\nIt's line by line,\ndetermining whether it really\n\n01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:06.600 align:middle line:90%\nneeds to be classified or not.\n\n01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.570 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it's easier just to\nclassify the whole damn document\n\n01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:13.170 align:middle line:90%\nthan to do that line by line.\n\n01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%\nAnd there was one more piece\nof it, of the declassification.\n\n01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.163 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah,\nI mean, that is also\n\n01:01:20.163 --> 01:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nRegardless of what\n\n01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%\nyou may have read\nin the press, it's\n\n01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%\nabout magic and\nwaving a magic wand.\n\n01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%\nThere is a\ndeclassification process.\n\n01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:32.600 align:middle line:84%\nOh, I know what I was going to\nsay on the classification side.\n\n01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%\nEspecially in the\nintelligence community,\n\n01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%\nthere are multiple agencies\nthat have equity in a document.\n\n01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:42.220 align:middle line:84%\nSo the classification\nmay have different levels\n\n01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%\nof classification within\nthe same document.\n\n01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%\nSo that relates to\ndeclassification also.\n\n01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%\nSo while the president does have\nthe authority to declassify,\n\n01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%\nthere is a process\nthat is followed,\n\n01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%\nso that the agencies who did\nthe original classification\n\n01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.192 align:middle line:90%\nare notified--\n\n01:01:59.192 --> 01:02:00.400 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: And can object.\n\n01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: --because\nthat's not the only copy.\n\n01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.110 align:middle line:90%\nOh, they can object.\n\n01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:06.670 align:middle line:84%\n[LAUGHS] That's\nnot the only copy\n\n01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:08.050 align:middle line:90%\nthat sits in the White House.\n\n01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.510 align:middle line:84%\nThe agencies that did the\noriginal classification,\n\n01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:11.710 align:middle line:90%\nthey have copies also.\n\n01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%\nSo it's very important\nthat the agencies\n\n01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%\nbe notified that that\nhas been declassified.\n\n01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And if I\nunderstand this correctly,\n\n01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%\none document can also\nhave the State Department\n\n01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.270 align:middle line:90%\nhas classified--\n\n01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO:\nMultiple equities.\n\n01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:27.890 align:middle line:90%\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: --the CIA\nhas classified part,\n\n01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:33.750 align:middle line:84%\nthe National Security Agency\nhas done a different--\n\n01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%\nSo and all of\nthose agencies have\n\n01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:39.590 align:middle line:84%\nto declassify that particular\nportion that they originally\n\n01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:40.270 align:middle line:90%\nclassified.\n\n01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:40.820 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yep.\n\n01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.150 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Is that?\n\n01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.690 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: That's it.\n\n01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:42.690 align:middle line:90%\nThat's the way it works.\n\n01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.030 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Yeah, no.\n\n01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.930 align:middle line:90%\nEasy-peasy.\n\n01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:46.070 align:middle line:90%\nAll right.\n\n01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%\nYour undergraduate degree\nis in English literature.\n\n01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%\nCan you speak to how that\ndegree or course of study\n\n01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.310 align:middle line:84%\ninfluenced your career,\nif it did at all,\n\n01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%\nand/or the broader role of\neducation in the humanities\n\n01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.700 align:middle line:84%\nin preparing people for\ncareers in information and/or\n\n01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%\npublic service.\n\n01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: I was\noriginally an education major.\n\n01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%\nI always thought I was going\nto teach when I first went\n\n01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:14.030 align:middle line:90%\nto Northeastern University.\n\n01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:20.970 align:middle line:84%\nAnd the education\ncourses were just so bad\n\n01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:22.763 align:middle line:90%\nthat I dropped out of school.\n\n01:03:22.763 --> 01:03:23.430 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh\n\n01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.305 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Yeah.\n\n01:03:24.305 --> 01:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%\nI Joined the Navy,\nand when I came back,\n\n01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%\nI was a liberal arts major and\nhad very different attitude\n\n01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:31.590 align:middle line:90%\ntoward higher education.\n\n01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%\nAnd took courses that\nwere meaningful to me\n\n01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%\nand a wide range across\nhistory, and literature,\n\n01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%\nand political science,\nand psychology.\n\n01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%\nAnd it was a well rounded\neducation which, I think,\n\n01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%\ngave me an important basis\nfor higher education,\n\n01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:52.530 align:middle line:90%\nbut also thinking about careers.\n\n01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%\nAnd at the same time I was\nworking in my co-op position\n\n01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%\nas a junior library\nassistant in the libraries\n\n01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%\nat MIT, which exposed me to\nall kinds of opportunities\n\n01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.240 align:middle line:90%\nabout library work.\n\n01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%\nSo it was the\ncombination of the two,\n\n01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.287 align:middle line:84%\nI think, that put\nme where I am today.\n\n01:04:11.287 --> 01:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: I like that.\n\n01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%\nSo you went from a junior\nlibrary position to working--\n\n01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: They\nknew they had someone\n\n01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.320 align:middle line:90%\non the hook when I came.\n\n01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%\nBecause I just volunteered\nto do anything.\n\n01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%\nFor those of you\nwho are old enough\n\n01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%\nto remember filing in the shelf\nlist, I was allowed to file--\n\n01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%\nme, a

that someone,\na real professional,\n\n01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%\ncame behind me and checked\nmy work to pull the rod\n\n01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.950 align:middle line:90%\nand drop the cart.\n\n01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%\nSo I wasn't doing\nthe filing, actually.\n\n01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.120 align:middle line:90%\nSARA STEFANI: Oh,

it's just\na horrible situation.\n\n01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:28.140 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I feel badly for\nespecially school librarians,\n\n01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%\nwho are the targets\nof a lot of this--\n\n01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%\nand some public\nlibrarians, also.\n\n01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.266 align:middle line:90%\nIt's hard for me to imagine.\n\n01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:39.630 align:middle line:90%\nNo, I guess it's not hard.\n\n01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:41.580 align:middle line:90%\nAnything, anything can happen.\n\n01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%\nIn terms of the\nway records might\n\n01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:50.760 align:middle line:84%\nbe influenced, the way the\nprocess works is that there\n\n01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.210 align:middle line:84%\nare records managers\nin each of the agencies\n\n01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%\nwho are responsible\nfor overseeing\n\n01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%\nall the regulations about\ncreation and maintenance\n\n01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.300 align:middle line:90%\nof records.\n\n01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%\nSo these are career\ncivil servants.\n\n01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.520 align:middle line:84%\nThey report, however,\nto their agencies.\n\n01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%\nIt's something that\nhas bothered me,\n\n01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.950 align:middle line:84%\nand in fact, I made\nrecommendations\n\n01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:20.010 align:middle line:84%\nthat all of the\nrecords folks should\n\n01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.330 align:middle line:90%\nbe reporting to the archives.\n\n01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:24.510 align:middle line:90%\n\n\n01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:28.480 align:middle line:84%\nLike the model that's used for\nthe Inspector General community\n\n01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.250 align:middle line:90%\nwithin the federal government.\n\n01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.040 align:middle line:84%\nThey sit in the\nagencies, but they\n\n01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.650 align:middle line:84%\nreport to a central\nInspector General Agency.\n\n01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%\nThere has been, and I can point\nto several examples of bias\n\n01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%\nin record keeping\nin various agencies.\n\n01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%\nBecause of the\npresidential appointment\n\n01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%\nat the head of the Agency hiding\ninformation or withholding\n\n01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:58.850 align:middle line:90%\ninformation.\n\n01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%\nAnd in some cases\nchanging information.\n\n01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.410 align:middle line:84%\nSo those are things\nthat would be addressed.\n\n01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%\nI think if that\nrecords manager was\n\n01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%\nmore comfortable in\nreporting it out.\n\n01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.795 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Right, and\nhad some accountability.\n\n01:07:10.795 --> 01:07:11.795 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Exactly.\n\n01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: And\nsomebody who could\n\n01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.010 align:middle line:90%\nnotice that and correct it.\n\n01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%\nIn terms of preservation,\nwhile it is currently\n\n01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%\nout of the capacity\nfor any

what?\n\n01:07:36.575 --> 01:07:37.950 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: So\nI will continue.\n\n01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:38.310 align:middle line:90%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Oh.\n\n01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%\n[LAUGHS]\n\n01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%\nSARA STEFANI: Do you think that\na website such as YouTube, one\n\n01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:44.880

it.\n\n01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:12.670 align:middle line:90%\nI mean, Yeah.\n\n01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:17.319 align:middle line:84%\nI mean, I'm sort of struck,\nand the details are fuzzy,\n\n01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%\nbut I know that there was an\nincident not long ago where--\n\n01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%\nI think it was\nmaybe in Ukraine--\n\n01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%\nbut somebody had posted\nsomething and then immediately\n\n01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.189 align:middle line:90%\ntaken it down.\n\n01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.859 align:middle line:84%\nBut it was still in\nthe internet archives,\n\n01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:37.300 align:middle line:84%\nand that was the only place that\nhad

line:90%\ntaken down.\n\n01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:49.065 align:middle line:84%\nSo I think this question of,\nyou have things on YouTube\n\n01:08:49.065 --> 01:08:51.729 align:middle line:84%\nand whether they have\nthat responsibility\n\n01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:53.689 align:middle line:84%\nas part of the record\nis an interesting one.\n\n01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:55.210 align:middle line:90%\nSo.\n\n01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:55.848 align:middle line:90%\nAll right--\n\n01:08:55.848 --> 01:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%\nDAVID FERRIERO: Can I\njust share two things\n\n01:08:57.640

worry about\naccess to records\n\n01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%\ngoes way back to\nthe very beginning.\n\n01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%\nAnd I got two
